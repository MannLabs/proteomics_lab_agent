## Abstract
This protocol explains how to connect an IonOpticks column inserted into a timsTOF Ultra with an sample line of an Evosep.


## Materials

### Equipment
- IonOpticks Column
- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer
  - Equipped with UltraSource ion source
  - Equipped with column oven for temperature control
- Evosep One LC System
  - with sample line
- NanoViper Adapter (black)
- Pliers


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*

1. Verfy that the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standing by mode.

### Connect column and sample line
2. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.
3. Attach a black NanoViper adapter to the LC sample line.
4. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.
5. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.
6. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 1).
   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.
7. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.
8. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).
9. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.
10. Close the lid of the oven.
11. Verify the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven, respectively.

### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow
12. In timsControl, transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.
13. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.
14. Return to timsControl. Check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.


## Expected Results
- In timsControl, signal intensity should be above 10^7
- Stable signal in in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)

","# Connecting an IonOpticks Aurora Series Column to a Bruker timsTOF for LC-MS/MS Analysis

## Abstract
This protocol provides a step-by-step guide for the correct physical and electrical connection of an IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column to the CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source of a Bruker timsTOF series mass spectrometer. The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.

## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 5-10 minutes (including heating time)*

### System Preparation and State Verification

1.  In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.
2.  **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.

### Physical Connection of the Column

3.  Wear clean laboratory gloves.
4.  Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.
5.  Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.
6.  Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.
7.  Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.

    > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.

### Positioning, Grounding, and Heating

8.  Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.
9.  Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.
10. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.
11. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.

### Establishing Electrospray and Signal

12. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.
13. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.
14. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.
15. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.

## Expected Results
- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.
- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.
- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray. The system is now ready for data acquisition.

-   Double-distilled water (ddH₂O)

## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 1.5 hours + overnight digestion*

### Bead Preparation and Protein Binding
1.  Aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry into a microcentrifuge tube or well of a 96-well plate.
2.  Place the tube/plate on a magnetic rack to capture the beads. Once the supernatant is clear, carefully remove and discard it.
3.  Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of ddH₂O, resuspending, capturing the beads on the magnetic rack, and discarding the supernatant. Repeat this step once for a total of two washes.
4.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the selected Binding/Wash Buffer.
5.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.
6.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking to facilitate protein binding.

### Washing and On-Bead Digestion
7.  Following incubation, capture the beads on the magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.
8.  Wash the beads twice with 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer per wash. For each wash, resuspend the beads completely before capturing them on the magnet and discarding the supernatant.
9.  Add 50 µL of Lysis Buffer to the washed beads.
10. Incubate for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking. This step lyses the bound proteins and simultaneously performs reduction and alkylation.
11. Briefly centrifuge the tube/plate to collect condensation, then allow it to cool to room temperature.
12. Add 10 µL of the freshly prepared Digestion Mix to each sample.
13. Incubate overnight (e.g., 12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking to digest the proteins.

### Peptide Recovery
14. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample and mix well by pipetting. The final volume is approximately 110 µL.
15. Place the tube/plate on the magnetic rack to capture the beads.
16. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which contains the final peptide solution, to a fresh tube or plate for LC-MS analysis. Discard the plate containing the residual beads.

## Expected Results
-   Processing 10 µL of plasma with this method should yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides.
-   For a standard LC-MS analysis, loading 20 µL of the final 100 µL peptide solution corresponds to an injection of approximately 160 ng of peptide material.

## Abstract
This protocol details a robust method for the enrichment and subsequent proteolytic digestion of proteins directly on magnetic beads. The procedure is optimized for plasma samples and involves protein binding to functionally-specific magnetic beads, stringent washing steps to remove non-specific binders, and an efficient on-bead digestion using a Trypsin/Lys-C mixture. The resulting peptide mixture is suitable for direct analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach minimizes sample handling losses and is readily adaptable for various affinity-based proteomics workflows, such as targeted protein pulldowns or analysis of post-translationally modified sub-proteomes.

## Materials

### Equipment
- **Magnetic separator:** A magnetic rack or device compatible with 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes or 96-well plates.

## Procedure
*Estimated timing: ~1.5 hours hands-on time, ~12-18 hours for overnight digestion.*

### Bead Preparation and Protein Binding
*Timing: ~45 minutes*

1.  In a microcentrifuge tube, aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry.
2.  Place the tube on a magnetic separator. Once the beads are captured and the supernatant is clear, carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant.
3.  Wash the beads by removing the tube from the magnet, adding 200 µL of ddH₂O, and gently resuspending the beads.
4.  Recapture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant. Repeat this wash step once for a total of two washes.
5.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the user-defined Binding/Wash Buffer.
6.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.
    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Ensure plasma is fully thawed and vortexed before addition. If starting with frozen plasma, centrifuge at high speed (e.g., 14,000 x g, 10 min, 4°C) to pellet any cryoprecipitates and use the clear supernatant.
7.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking in a thermomixer to facilitate protein binding.

### Washing
*Timing: ~15 minutes*

8.  Following incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube at 2,000 x g for 1 minute to pellet the beads.
    * **Alternative:** Use a magnetic separator to capture the beads. Centrifugation is recommended to ensure collection of all beads.
9.  Place the tube on the magnetic separator, allow the beads to be captured, and carefully discard the supernatant.
10. Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer and gently resuspending.
11. Capture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant.
12. Repeat steps 10-11 once for a total of two washes. After the final wash, remove the supernatant as completely as possible.
    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Complete removal of the wash buffer is essential to avoid interfering with the subsequent digestion step. Use a small-volume pipette tip to remove any residual liquid after the main aspiration.

### On-Bead Digestion
*Timing: ~25 minutes hands-on, 4 hours to overnight for digestion*

13. Resuspend the washed beads in 50 µL of Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB).
14. Incubate the sample for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking in a thermomixer to denature, reduce, and alkylate the bound proteins.
15. After incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube to collect any condensate from the lid and walls. Let the sample cool to room temperature (~5-10 minutes).
16. Prepare a fresh Trypsin/Lys-C enzyme master mix. For each sample, combine:
    * Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB): 8 µL
    * Trypsin stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL
    * Lys-C stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL
    * *Note: Prepare a master mix for all samples, including a 10% excess to account for pipetting inaccuracies. For example, for 10 samples, mix 88 µL LDB, 11 µL Trypsin, and 11 µL Lys-C.*
17. Add 10 µL of the enzyme master mix to each sample. The total volume is now ~60 µL.
18. Digest the proteins by incubating the samples overnight (12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking.
    * **PAUSE POINT:** The digestion time can be optimized. A shorter digestion of 4 hours may be sufficient for some applications.

### Sample Acidification and Peptide Collection
*Timing: ~10 minutes*

19. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample. Mix well by pipetting up and down. The final volume will be approximately 110 µL.
20. Place the tubes on the magnetic separator to capture the beads.
21. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which now contains the digested peptides, to a fresh, clean 96-well plate or microcentrifuge tube. Discard the plate/tubes containing the beads. The sample is now ready for LC-MS/MS analysis or further fractionation.

## Expected Results
-   Starting with 10 µL of human plasma, this enrichment and digestion procedure is expected to yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides in the final 110 µL volume.
-   A standard injection volume for LC-MS/MS analysis would be 20 µL of the final peptide solution, corresponding to a load of approximately 150-160 ng of peptides on the column.
