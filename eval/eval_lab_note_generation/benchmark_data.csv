PlaceEvotips_docuCorrect,"The page titled ""Placing Evotips in Evotip Boxes on the Evosep One System"" contains following information: - ## Abstract
This protocol describes the proper procedure for inspecting Evotips and placing Evotips in Evotip boxes on the liquid chromatography system Evosep One.


## Materials

### Equipment
- Evotips
  - Single-use stage tips for sample injection
  - Rack layout: Two columns (left and right)
  - Left column (top to bottom): S1, S2, S3
  - Right column (top to bottom): S4, S5, S6
  - Within each box: Standard 96-well format with A1 (top left), A12 (top right), H12 (bottom right)
- Evotip Boxes
  - 96-well format (A1-H12) (Figure 1)
- Evosep One System
  - Liquid chromatography system

### Reagents
- Formic acid (FA)
  ! CAUTION: This liquid may be corrosive. It is harmful and can cause damage if direct contact occurs.

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA. The buffers are stable for at least 6 months at room temperature as long as they are protected from sunlight.


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: less than 1 minute*

1. Visually inspect the Evotip box intended for S1 to verify it's filled with Buffer A solution to a minimum depth of 1 cm. Verification of the Evotip box placed at S3 is not necessary as it will only contain blanks.
2. Place Evotip Box at S1 within the rack system of the Evosep instrument. Ensure each box is firmly seated in its designated position.
3. Place an empty Evotip Box for Blank tips at S3. Ensure each box is firmly seated in its designated position.
4. Inspect each Evotip before placement to verify its condition. Properly prepared Evotips should display a pale-colored SPE material disc with visible solvent above it (Figure 2).
   **CRITICAL STEP**: Discard any Evotips showing signs of dryness or displaying a white-colored disc, as these conditions indicate compromised functionality that could affect sample analysis.
5. Place the verified Evotips into the prepared Evotip boxes at S1 from A1 to A6.
6. Place empty Evotips, called Blanks, at S3 from A1 to A6.
7. Document the precise position of each placed Evotip.


## Expected Results
When the procedure is performed correctly, you should observe:
- Properly seated Evotip boxes in the rack system
- Visible Buffer A solution in boxes (1 cm depth)
- All non-blank Evotips showing pale-colored SPE material discs & clear solvent meniscus above each SPE disc of each Evotip
- Accurate documentation of tip positions: Evotips that are placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks placed at S3 from A1 to A6.

## Abstract
This protocol describes the procedure for switching from the ESI source to UltraSource.


## Materials

### Equipment
- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer:
  - Equipped with an ESI ion source
  - UltraSource ion source ready to attach
- IonOpticks Column
- Evosep One LC System with sample line
- NanoViper Adapter (black)
- Pliers


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: less than 10 minute*

### Switch timsTOF to standby
1. In timsControl, verfy if the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standy by mode  (Figure 1).
2. Verify that the syringe is inactive in the tab 'Source' under 'Syringe Pump'. If not click on 'Stop'.
3. In the 'source' and 'source type' sections of timsControl, choose 'CaptiveSpray' but do not activate it yet.

### Remove ESI source
4. At the instrument, disconnect the peak connector of the sample tubing (Figure 2).
5. Disconnect the nebulizer N₂ line.
6. Remove the ESI source housing by hinging it out like a regular door.
7. Put on laboratory gloves.
8. Remove the spray shield
   ! CAUTION: The spray shield is hot.
9. Remove the capillary cap.
   ! CAUTION: The capillary cap is hot.
10. Inspect the capillary position. If it appears to be partially pulled out, gently push it back into proper position without blocking the gas flow.

### Mount UltraSource
11. Hinge the UltraSource door in and close it (Figure 3).
12. Slide the UltraSource housing onto the source door and secure it by flipping the handles located at the top right and bottom left by 180°.
13. Connect the filter tubing to the source.

### Connect column and sample line
14. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.
15. Verify if the LC sample line has a black NanoViper adapter attached. If not, locate an adapter and securely attach it to the sample line.
16. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.
17. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.
18. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 3).
   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.
19. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).
20. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.
21. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.
22. Close the lid of the oven.
23. Connect the oven to the electrical power supply.
24. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blincking light indicates that the oven is heating up.
    CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.

### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow
25. In timsCOntrol, activate the CaptiveSpray function in timsControl (Figure 1)
26. Transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.
27. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.
28. Return to timsControl and check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.
29. Monitor the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. The funnel pressur is acceptable within a 9-11 mbar range. Aim for a 10 mbar funnel pressure. Adjust the 'funnel pressure' wheel if necessary by turning counter clock-wise to reduce the pressure.


## Expected Results
- In timsControl, signal intensity should be above 10^7
- Stable signal in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)

## Abstract
This protocol describes the procedure for switching from the UltraSource to the ESI source.


## Materials

### Equipment
- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer:
  - Equipped with an UltraSource ion source
  - ESI source on the side to attach


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: less than 10 minute*

### Switch TimsControl to 'Standby' mode
1. Verify that the IonOpticks column from an Evosep System is disconnected. If not disconnect them.
   Critical step: This could be an opportune moment to perform the weekly LC system maintenance.
2. In timsControl, verfy that the software is in standby mode
3. Navigate to the 'Source', then proceed to 'SourceType' and select 'ESI'. However, do not activate the source at this moment (Figure 1).

### Remove UltraSource
4. Disconnect the power supply of the oven.
5. Disconnect the filter tubing.
6. Rotate the top right and bottom left handles of the UltraSource housing by 180 degrees.
7. Slide off the UltraSource housing from both the source door and the glass capillary.
8. Set the UltraSource housing on the bench.
   Critical step: Never attempt to open the source door while the UltraSource is connected with the glass capillary (Figure 2). Such an action will cause breakage of the glass capillary.
9. Remove the source door by opening it and unhinging it, similar to the motion of a normal door.
10. Set it aside (Figure 2).

### Mount Apollo ESI source
11. Put on gloves.
12. Attach the capillary cap securely to the glass capillary (Figure 3)
   Critical step: Try not to block the vacuum flow to avoid contamination of the timsTOF for instance by blocking the whole of the capillary cap.
13. Attach the spray shield to the desolvation stage housing.
14. Hinging the ESI source housing into position as it would be a door and close it.
15. Connect the sample inlet of the ESI source and the peak tubing lines, which originate from the syringe, by turning it clock-wise.
16. Connect the nebulizer gas inlet to the N₂ line.

### Prepare the setup by loading the syringe with Tuning Mix
17. Remove old solvent.
18. Withdraw new Tuning Mix liquid.
19. Ensure it is devoid of air bubbles.
20. Connect the syringe to the peak tubing of the sample line.
21. Mount this syringe within the external syringe pump setup. The golden button allows to move the syringe holder to arrange the syringe as in Figure 3.
22. Press some solved out of the syringe to fill the sample line.

### Switch TimsControl to 'Operate' mode
23. Activate the ESI source within the TimsControl software (Figure 1).
24. Transition the instrument into 'operate' mode by clicking on the on/off symbol.
25. Begin flow at the syringe, ensuring that the following settings are in place in the tab 'Source' (Figure 1): Syringe: Hamilton 500 µL; Flow Rate: 3 µL/min. Press start. Keep the button next to start/stop pressed until a signal is observed in the 'Chromatogram View' and 'TIMS View' windows, which usually happens within 30 seconds.

## Expected Results
- Signal intensity should reach approximately 1.5x10^7
- Stable signal in in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)

UltraSourceToESIsource_docuForgotN2Line,"# Change source: UltraSource to ESI source


## Abstract
This protocol describes the procedure for switching from the UltraSource to the ESI source.


## Materials

### Equipment
- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer:
  - Equipped with an UltraSource ion source
  - ESI source on the side to attach


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: less than 10 minute*

### Switch TimsControl to 'Standby' mode
1. Verify that the IonOpticks column from an Evosep System is disconnected. If not disconnect them.
   Critical step: This could be an opportune moment to perform the weekly LC system maintenance.
2. In timsControl, verfy that the software is in standby mode
3. Navigate to the 'Source', then proceed to 'SourceType' and select 'ESI'. However, do not activate the source at this moment (Figure 1).

### Remove UltraSource
4. Disconnect the power supply of the oven.
5. Disconnect the filter tubing.
6. Rotate the top right and bottom left handles of the UltraSource housing by 180 degrees.
7. Slide off the UltraSource housing from both the source door and the glass capillary.
8. Set the UltraSource housing on the bench.
   Critical step: Never attempt to open the source door while the UltraSource is connected with the glass capillary (Figure 2). Such an action will cause breakage of the glass capillary.
9. Remove the source door by opening it and unhinging it, similar to the motion of a normal door.
10. Set it aside (Figure 2).

### Mount Apollo ESI source
11. Put on gloves.
12. Attach the capillary cap securely to the glass capillary (Figure 3)
   Critical step: Try not to block the vacuum flow to avoid contamination of the timsTOF for instance by blocking the whole of the capillary cap.
13. Attach the spray shield to the desolvation stage housing.
14. Hinging the ESI source housing into position as it would be a door and close it.
15. Connect the sample inlet of the ESI source and the peak tubing lines, which originate from the syringe, by turning it clock-wise.
16. Connect the nebulizer gas inlet to the N₂ line.

### Prepare the setup by loading the syringe with Tuning Mix
17. Remove old solvent.
18. Withdraw new Tuning Mix liquid.
19. Ensure it is devoid of air bubbles.
20. Connect the syringe to the peak tubing of the sample line.
21. Mount this syringe within the external syringe pump setup. The golden button allows to move the syringe holder to arrange the syringe as in Figure 3.
22. Press some solved out of the syringe to fill the sample line.

### Switch TimsControl to 'Operate' mode
23. Activate the ESI source within the TimsControl software (Figure 1).
24. Transition the instrument into 'operate' mode by clicking on the on/off symbol.
25. Begin flow at the syringe, ensuring that the following settings are in place in the tab 'Source' (Figure 1): Syringe: Hamilton 500 µL; Flow Rate: 3 µL/min. Press start. Keep the button next to start/stop pressed until a signal is observed in the 'Chromatogram View' and 'TIMS View' windows, which usually happens within 30 seconds.

## Expected Results
- Signal intensity should reach approximately 1.5x10^7
- Stable signal in in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)

15. Connected the sample inlet of the ESI source and the peak tubing lines, which originated from the syringe, by turning it clockwise.
16. Connected the nebulizer gas inlet to the N₂ line.

### Prepare the setup by loading the syringe with Tuning Mix
17. Removed old solvent.
18. Withdrew new Tuning Mix liquid.
19. Ensured it was devoid of air bubbles.
20. Connected the syringe to the peak tubing of the sample line.
21. Mounted this syringe within the external syringe pump setup. The golden button allowed movement of the syringe holder to arrange the syringe as in Figure 3.
22. Pressed some solvent out of the syringe to fill the sample line.

### Switch TimsControl to 'Operate' mode
23. Activated the ESI source within the TimsControl software.
24. Transitioned the instrument into 'operate' mode by clicking on the on/off symbol.
25. Began flow at the syringe, ensuring that the following settings were in place in the tab 'Source': Syringe: Hamilton 500 µL; Flow Rate: 3 µL/min. Pressed start. Kept the button next to start/stop pressed until a signal was observed in the 'Chromatogram View' and 'TIMS View' windows, which happened within 30 seconds.



## Results
- Signal intensity reached approximately 1.5x10^7
- Stable signal was observed in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)

DisconnectingColumn_docuCorrect,"# Disconnecting a IonOpticks column from an Evosep System

## Abstract
This protocol describes how to disconnect an IonOpticks column from an Evosep liquid chromatography system when the column is installed in the UltraSource of a timsTOF mass spectrometer.


## Materials

### Equipment
- IonOpticks Column
- timsTOF Mass Spectrometer:
  - Equipped with UltraSource ion source
- Evosep One LC System
  - with sample line
- NanoViper Adapter (black)
- Pliers


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 1 minute*

### Verify timsTOF is in standby mode:
1. Check timsControl software status in top left corner.
2. If in ""Operate"" mode, click the power symbol to transition to ""Standby"" (Figure 1, top left).

### Disconnect IonOpticks column and Evosep:
3. Open the lid of the column oven (column toaster).
4. Loosen the securing screw at the sample line - column connection (Figure 2F), which has the purpose to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven. Lift it up and move the metal grounding screw away from the column-sample line connection.
5. Attach the NanoViper adapter to the sample line for easier handling.
6. Hold the column fitting with pliers for easier handling.
7. Unscrew the NanoViper connector to detach the sample line from the IonOpticks column by turning it counter clock-wise.
8. Position the sample line ensuring it does not bend. One method is to place it over the transparent bumper of the Evosep.


## Expected Results
- The timsTOF is in standby mode
- The column should be completely detached from the Evosep

TimsCalibration_docuCorrect,"# Calibrate the TIMS device


## Abstract
This protocol explains how to calibrate a TIMS device in timsControl.
Important: We recommend to calibrate the TIMS device each time before a sample queue is started.


## Materials

### Software
| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |
|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| timsControl | 6.0 (latest) | Software to control timsTof mass spectrometers | Available on every instrument computer |


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*

Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.
1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.
2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).
3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.
4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.
5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).
6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.
7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.
8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).
9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).
10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.
11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.
12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.
13. Select ""Method"" > ""Load Recent"", select the same method, and then click ""Discard changes"" in the pop-up window.
14. Set MS averaging to 1.


## Expected Results
- The score in the tab ""Calibration"" should be at 100%

The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.
2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).
3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.
4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.
5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).
6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.
7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.
8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).
9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).
10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.
11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.
12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.
13. Select ""Method"" > ""Load Recent"", select the same method, and then click ""Discard changes"" in the pop-up window.
14. Set MS averaging to 1.

## Abstract
This protocol explains how to queue sample in HyStar for LC-MS measurement.


## Materials

### Software
| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |
|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| HyStar | 6.0 | Controls LC and MS | On every instrument computer |


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*

1. Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.
    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.
2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.
3. In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.
4. Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.
5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.
6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: ""SA_blank"", ""MA_HeLa"", ""DIAMA_HeLa"".
7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.
    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.
8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.
9. Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.
10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.
11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.
12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.
13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.
14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.
15. Save the sample table.
16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.
17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.


## Expected Results
Typical chromatogram shape with MS TIC (green line) increasing drastically around 4 minutes and another increase (wash-out) at 15 minutes. Higher MS2 intensities (red line) for dia-PASEF.

QueueSamples_docuWrongRow_S3A1Twice,"# Queue and measure samples in HyStar


## Abstract
This protocol explains how to queue sample in HyStar for LC-MS measurement.


## Materials

### Software
| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |
|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| HyStar | 6.0 | Controls LC and MS | On every instrument computer |


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*

1. Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.
    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.
2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.
3. In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.
4. Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.
5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.
6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: ""SA_blank"", ""MA_HeLa"", ""DIAMA_HeLa"".
7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.
    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.
8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.
9. Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.
10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.
11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.
12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.
13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.
14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.
15. Save the sample table.
16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.
17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.


## Expected Results
Typical chromatogram shape with MS TIC (green line) increasing drastically around 4 minutes and another increase (wash-out) at 15 minutes. Higher MS2 intensities (red line) for dia-PASEF.

Queuing samples in HyStar for LC-MS measurement.


## Materials
### Software
HyStar 6.0


## Procedure
*Timing: 2 minutes*

1. Verified that Evotips are placed on top of Evosep. 5 ng HeLa Evotips at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.
2. Verified that the calibration of the TIMS device in TimsControl is valid.
3. In Hystar, navigated to the 'Acquisition' tab.
4. Chose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.
5. Copied already existing sample table entries to modify them.
6. Adjusted the sample ID so that it followed this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_sampleName.
7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, queued one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ended with another blank.
8. Verified the column autocompletion settings by right-clicking on a field in the column 'vial' and selected 'Configure'. Values were set to autocomplete from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensured that the tray type was set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 were designated as '96Evotip'. Pressed 'OK'.
9. ❌ **Error:** Tried to matched the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box.
However, the researcher chose the wrong row to queue the HeLa samples. They selected S1 from B1 to B6 but the samples are at S1 from A1 to A6. Additionally S3 A1 is twice in sample table but every position can only be defined once within a queue.
10. Verified 'path' folder for storing the raw files.
11. Verified separation method.
12. Verified that injection method is set to 'standard'.
13. At 'MS method', adjusted dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods according to sample ID.
14. ❌ **Omitted:** Missed to stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and select 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.
15. Saved the sample table.
16. Right-clicked on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and selected 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS methods could be loaded correctly. The status changed to loaded.
17. Pressed 'start' and 'start sequence'.

6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: ""SA_blank"", ""MA_HeLa"", ""DIAMA_HeLa"".
7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.
    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.
8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.
9. Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.
10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.
11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.
12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.
13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.
14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.
15. Save the sample table.
16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.
17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.


## Expected Results
Typical chromatogram shape with MS TIC (green line) increasing drastically around 4 minutes and another increase (wash-out) at 15 minutes. Higher MS2 intensities (red line) for dia-PASEF.
