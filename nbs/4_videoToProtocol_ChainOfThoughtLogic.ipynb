       "*Estimated timing: 5 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Check the software.** Ensure that the timsTOF SCP instrument is in standby mode in the timsControl software. If the instrument is in operate mode, switch it to standby mode.\n",
       "2. **Connect the column to the sample line.**\n",
       "    a. Insert the IonOpticks column into the Ultrasource.\n",
       "    b. Connect the nano connector adapter to the sample line.\n",
       "    c. Connect the sample line to the column using the adapter.\n",
       "    d. Check for leaks by visually inspecting the connection for any liquid droplets. If there are leaks, tighten the connection or replace the column or emitter.\n",
       "3. **Secure the connection.** Use pliers to tighten the sample line connector to the column. Ensure that the connection is finger tight but not over tightened.\n",
       "4. **Remove the adapter.** Carefully remove the nano connector adapter from the sample line.\n",
       "5. **Position the column oven.**\n",
       "    a. Loosen the screw on the column oven to adjust its position.\n",
       "    b. Move the oven as close as possible to the source.\n",
       "    c. Tighten the screw to secure the oven in place.\n",
       "6. **Ground the column.**\n",
       "    a. Locate the grounding screw on the column oven.\n",
       "    b. Use the screw to ground the column to the oven.\n",
       "    c. If the column is longer, use the additional grounding screw on the oven to ensure proper grounding.\n",
       "7. **Close the column oven.** Ensure that the lid is securely closed.\n",
       "8. **Set the column oven temperature.**\n",
       "    a. Check the temperature indicator on the column oven.\n",
       "    b. Adjust the temperature to 50°C for IonOpticks columns. The temperature is indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column toaster.\n",
       "    c. Wait for the temperature to stabilize. The lights will stop blinking when the temperature is stable.\n",
       "9. **Switch the instrument to operate mode.** In the timsControl software, click the on/off button to switch the instrument to operate mode.\n",
       "10. **Check the idle flow.** In the HyStar software, check that the idle flow is on. If it is not, right-click on the Evosep logo, select 'Preparation', then select 'Idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
       "11. **Confirm signal.** Verify that there is signal in the timsControl and HyStar software.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Expected Results\n",
       "\n",
       "After completing these steps, the IonOpticks column should be properly connected to the timsTOF SCP instrument. The instrument should be in operate mode, the idle flow should be on, and there should be signal in both the timsControl and HyStar software.\n",
