       "16. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\n",
       "17. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\n",
       "18. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 3).\n",
       "   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n",

       "1.  In timsControl, verfy if the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standy by mode (Figure 1).\n",
       "2.  Verify that the syringe is inactive in the tab 'Source' under 'Syringe Pump'. If not click on 'Stop'.\n",

       "15. Verify if the LC sample line has a black NanoViper adapter attached. If not, locate an adapter and securely attach it to the sample line.\n",
       "16. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\n",
       "17. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\n",
       "18. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 3).\n",
       "    CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n",

       "22. Close the lid of the oven.\n",
       "23. Connect the oven to the electrical power supply.\n",
       "24. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blincking light indicates that the oven is heating up.\n",
       "    CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.\n",

       "26. Transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\n",
       "27. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
       "28. Return to timsControl and check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\n",
       "29. Monitor the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. The funnel pressur is acceptable within a 9-11 mbar range. Aim for a 10 mbar funnel pressure. Adjust the 'funnel pressure' wheel if necessary by turning counter clock-wise to reduce the pressure.\n",

       "## Aim\n",
       "This document describes the observed procedure for switching the ion source on a timsTOF Ultra mass spectrometer from an ESI source to an UltraSource, as performed in the provided video recording.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Materials\n",
       "\n",
       "### Equipment\n",
       "- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer (initially equipped with ESI source)\n",
       "- UltraSource ion source components (door, housing with integrated column oven)\n",

       "*Timing: Approximately 3 minutes 38 seconds*\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch timsTOF to standby\n",
       "1.  The instrument status in timsControl was initially \"Operating\". The researcher clicked the on/off icon ([00:00:15]), and the instrument transitioned to \"Standing by\" mode ([00:00:17]).\n",
       "2.  The syringe pump status was verified in the 'Source' tab and confirmed to be \"Inactive\" ([00:00:18]).\n",
       "3.  In the 'Source Type' dropdown menu, \"CaptiveSpray\" was selected ([00:00:19]). The resulting \"Change Source\" pop-up was cancelled for the moment ([00:00:21]).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Remove ESI source\n",
       "4.  At the instrument, the PEEK connector of the sample tubing was disconnected from the ESI source ([00:00:30]).\n",
       "5.  The nebulizer N₂ line (blue tube) was disconnected ([00:00:35]).\n",
       "6.  ❌ **Error:** The ESI source *housing* (black half-sphere) was removed ([00:00:42]). The source *door* itself was not removed.\n",
       "7.  The researcher wore laboratory gloves throughout the procedure.\n",
       "8.  The metal spray shield was removed ([00:00:51]).\n",
       "9.  The metal capillary cap was removed ([00:00:52]).\n",
       "10. The capillary position was visually inspected ([00:00:55]). No adjustment was made.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Mount UltraSource\n",
       "11. The UltraSource door (metal ring component) was hinged onto the instrument interface and secured using its clamps ([01:03:00]-[01:08:00]).\n",
       "12. The UltraSource housing (black assembly with oven) was slid onto the door and secured by flipping the handles at the top right and bottom left ([01:18:00]-[01:30:00]).\n",
       "13. The filter tubing (white corrugated tube) was connected to the source housing ([01:39:00]).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Connect column and sample line\n",
       "14. An IonOpticks column was observed to be already inserted into the UltraSource oven ([01:58:00]).\n",
       "15. The LC sample line was verified to have a black NanoViper adapter attached ([02:03:00]).\n",
       "16. ❌ **Omitted:** Excess liquid was not removed from the NanoViper tip.\n",
       "17. The column fitting was held with pliers ([02:12:00]).\n",
       "18. The NanoViper adapter of the LC sample line was hand-tightened onto the column fitting ([02:14:00]).\n",
       "19. The oven assembly was drawn closer to the UltraSource body and secured using the screw at its bottom-left ([02:30:00]-[02:33:00]).\n",
       "20. ❌ **Omitted:** The NanoViper adapter was not removed after tightening.\n",
       "21. The metal grounding screw was lifted and placed onto the column-sample line connection point ([02:36:00]).\n",
       "22. The lid of the oven was closed ([02:39:00]).\n",
       "23. The oven was connected to the electrical power supply ([02:40:00]).\n",
       "24. Three LEDs on the column oven illuminated, indicating the oven was heating up ([02:43:00]).\n",

       "### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\n",
       "25. In timsControl, the \"Activate Source\" button on the pending \"Change Source\" pop-up was clicked ([02:56:00]).\n",
       "26. The instrument was transitioned back to \"Operating\" mode using the on/off button in timsControl ([03:01:00]-[03:03:00]).\n",
       "27. ❌ **Omitted:** Navigation to Hystar software to check or activate the idle flow was not performed.\n",
       "28. The MS signal was observed in timsControl ([03:09:00], [03:24:00]). The signal appeared to stabilize towards the end of the recording.\n",
       "29. ⚠️ **Deviation:** & ❌ **Error:** Internal pressures were monitored via the pop-up in timsControl ([03:03:00], [03:19:00], [03:21:00]). The Funnel pressure was observed to be within the acceptable range (~1.01-1.02e+01 mbar). Although adjustment was not required based on the reading, the researcher adjusted the 'Source pressure' wheel (right-hand wheel) ([03:12:00]), contrary to the protocol's instruction to adjust the 'Funnel pressure' wheel (left-hand wheel) if needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Results\n",
       "- Following the procedure, the timsTOF was in \"Operating\" mode with the UltraSource installed and connected ([03:03:00]).\n",
       "- In timsControl, the MS signal was observed, and pressures were monitored. Funnel pressure was approximately 1.01e+01 mbar ([03:21:00]).\n",
       "- The signal display in timsControl showed traces populating in the Mobilogram and mass spectrum views by the end of the video ([03:24:00])."

       "*Estimated timing: less than 10 minute*\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch TimsControl to 'Standby' mode\n",
       "1.  Verify that the IonOpticks column from an Evosep System is disconnected. If not disconnect them.\n",
       "    Critical step: This could be an opportune moment to perform the weekly LC system maintenance.\n",
       "2.  In timsControl, verfy that the software is in standby mode\n",

       "11. Put on gloves.\n",
       "12. Attach the capillary cap securely to the glass capillary (G in Figure 3)\n",
       "    Critical step: Try not to block the vacuum flow to avoid contamination of the timsTOF for instance by blocking the whole of the capillary cap.\n",
       "13. Attach the spray shield (E) to the desolvation stage housing.\n",
       "14. Hinging the ESI source (F) into position as it would be a door and close it.\n",
       "15. Connect the sample inlet (B) of the ESI source and the peak tubing lines, which originate from the syringe, by turning it clock-wise.\n",
       "16. Connect the nebulizer gas inlet (C) to the N₂ line.\n",
       "\n",

       "19. Ensure it is devoid of air bubbles.\n",
       "20. Connect the syringe to the peak tubing of the sample line.\n",
       "21. Mount this syringe within the external syringe pump setup. The golden button allows to move the syringe holder to arrange the syringe as in Figure 3.\n",
       "22. Press some solved out of the syringe to fill the sample line.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch TimsControl to 'Operate' mode\n",
       "23. Activate the ESI source within the TimsControl software (Figure 1).\n",
       "24. Transition the instrument into 'operate' mode by clicking on the on/off symbol.\n",
       "25. Begin flow at the syringe, ensuring that the following settings are in place in the tab 'Source' (Figure 1): Syringe: Hamilton 500 µL; Flow Rate: 3 µL/min. Press start. Keep the button next to start/stop pressed until a signal is observed in the 'Chromatogram View' and 'TIMS View' windows, which usually happens within 30 seconds.\n",

       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4.  Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5.  Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6.  In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",

       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4.  Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5.  Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6.  In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7.  **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8.  Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9.  Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",

       "1.  A performance evaluation method (likely dda-PASEF) was observed loaded in timsControl, with an initial ion mobility (1/K₀) range set from 0.70 to 1.30 Vs/cm² (`00:00:00`).\n",
       "2.  The locked sign adjacent to the '1/K₀ End' field was activated (`00:00:06`).\n",
       "3.  The '1/K₀ Start' value was adjusted from 0.70 to 0.85. Consequently, the '1/K₀ End' value automatically updated to 1.45, shifting the ion mobility range to 0.85-1.45 Vs/cm² (`00:00:08`).\n",
       "4.  ❌ **Omitted:** The operator did not visibly wait for the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) to stabilize after adjusting the range; they proceeded to the next step within approximately 6 seconds (`00:00:08` - `00:00:14`).\n",
       "5.  The 'Scan Mode' was switched from 'dda-PASEF' to 'MS' (`00:00:16`), and the 'MS Averaging' was set from 1 to 30 (`00:00:19`). Deactivation of the polygon heatmap was not observed as it was not active.\n",
       "6.  Navigation occurred to the 'Calibration' tab, followed by the 'Mobility' sub-tab (`00:00:21` - `00:00:22`).\n",
       "7.  **(Protocol notes 'Not included in video')** The required reference list, '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)', containing calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221, was observed to be pre-selected upon opening the 'Mobility' tab (`00:00:23`).\n",
       "8.  The required calibration parameters (Mode: Linear, Detection Range: 5.0 %, Width: ± 0.1 Da) were observed to be pre-specified (`00:00:23`).\n",
       "9.  The 'Calibrate' button was selected (`00:00:24`).\n",
       "10. After calibration completion, the operator verified the peak picking by clicking on the main calibrants (622, 922, 1221) in the reference list (`00:00:29` - `00:00:33`).\n",
       "11. The calibrant peaks were observed to be correctly centered in the TIMS view window, and no manual adjustments were made (`00:00:29` - `00:00:33`).\n",
       "12. The calibration score reached 100% (`00:00:28`), and the 'Accept' button was pressed (`00:00:34`).\n",
       "13. An attempt was made to save the method using 'Method' -> 'Save Method As...' (`00:00:40`). When prompted regarding modified changes, 'Discard all changes' was selected (`00:00:43`).\n",
       "14. The 'MS Averaging' value was reset from 30 back to 1 (`00:00:47`).\n",

       "- The score in the \"Calibration -> Mobility\" tab reached 100% (`00:00:28`), fulfilling the expected outcome.\n",

       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀.

       "*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",
       "13. Try to save the method and say \"Discard all changes\".\n",

       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4.  Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5.  Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6.  In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7.  **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8.  Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9.  Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",

       "## Expected Results\n",

       "9.  **Followed correctly:** The Evotip positions for the new samples (rows 9-14) were matched to S1 A1 through S1 A6 using the vial dropdown selector followed by the autofill function. [00:01:06 - 00:01:21]\n",
       "10. **Followed correctly (Implicitly):** A data path folder was present for the new rows, inherited from the copied entries, and was implicitly accepted. [00:01:24]\n",
       "11. **Followed correctly (Implicitly):** An existing separation method was present for the new rows, inherited from the copied entries, and was implicitly accepted. [00:01:24]\n",
       "12. **Followed correctly:** The injection method was set to 'standard', inherited from the copied entries. [00:01:24]\n",
       "13. **Followed correctly:** Appropriate MS methods (dda/dia maintenance) were loaded for the new rows, inherited from the copied entries. [00:01:24]\n",
       "14. **Followed correctly:** The idle flow on the Evosep was stopped by right-clicking the instrument logo and selecting 'Cancel Maintenance Procedure'. [00:01:36 - 00:01:38]\n",
       "15. **Followed correctly:** The modified sample table was saved using the 'Save As...' button. [00:01:41]\n",
       "16. **Followed correctly:** The sample conditions for the newly defined rows (9-14) were uploaded, and the status change to 'sample data loaded' was observed. [00:01:43 - 00:01:49]\n",
       "17. **Followed correctly:** The measurement sequence was initiated by pressing 'Start' then 'Start Sequence'. [00:01:50 - 00:01:54]\n",

       "The HyStar software initiated the programmed LC-MS sequence. Chromatogram data acquisition commenced for the first sample in the modified queue (row 9). The expected typical chromatogram shapes were not observable within the timeframe of the recording, which concluded shortly after sequence initiation."

       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",

The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",

To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",

However, the critical step of starting with a blank (S1-A1) was observed. The sequence within S1 and S3 followed a pattern (blank, DDA, DDA, DDA, DIA, DIA, DIA, Blank/Unknown for A8) loosely based on the recommendation but applied to A1-A8 and duplicated for S3.\n",

       "\n",
       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",

       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table.

       "6.  The 'Sample ID' field for each new entry was adjusted, modifying the date prefix and sample type information (blank, dda-PASEF, dia-PASEF) [00:00:29-00:00:33].\n",
       "7.  A sequence was prepared consisting of one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs, and a final blank, adhering to the critical step of using a sacrificial first run [Implied 00:00:31-00:00:41].\n",
       "8.  The column autocompletion settings were verified by right-clicking a 'Vial' field, selecting 'Configure...', confirming 'Evosep' tray type and '96evotip' slot designations, and clicking 'OK' [00:00:50-00:00:52].\n",
       "9.  Evotip positions were matched to the samples: 'S1 A1' was selected for the first sample [00:00:46]. The auto-fill function was used to populate positions 'S1 A2' through 'S1 A7' for the subsequent six samples [00:00:55-00:00:57]. 'S3 A1' was manually selected for the final blank sample [01:03-01:08].\n",
       "10. A data path folder for storing the raw files was specified for the new samples using the auto-fill function [01:13-01:15].\n",
       "11. An existing separation method ('VHvaperInj\\_zoom') was utilized for the new samples, carried over from the copied entries [Implied 00:00:25].\n",
       "12. The 'standard' injection method was utilized for the new samples, carried over from the copied entries [Implied 00:00:25].\n",

       "14. ❌ **Omitted:** The idle flow on the Evosep was not stopped via the 'Cancel maintenance procedure' command.\n",
       "15. The modified sample table was saved using the 'Save As...' function [01:17-01:20].\n",
       "16. The sample conditions for the newly defined entries were uploaded by selecting the rows, right-clicking, and choosing 'Upload Sample Conditions'. The status changed to 'sample data loaded' [01:21-01:28].\n",

       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",

       "\n",
       "1.  **Partially aligned** The researcher stated that Evotips were placed on the Evosep LC system (5 ng HeLa at S1 A1-A6, blanks at S3 A1-A6) [00:00:02]. Visual verification of the physical placement was not recorded.\n",
       "2.  ❌ **Omitted:** Verification of TIMS device calibration in TimsControl was not performed.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, the 'Acquisition' tab was clicked [00:00:17].\n",
       "4.  An existing sample table (\"2025\\_MH\\_Georgia\\_Luke\\_...\") was selected from the navigator panel [00:00:19].\n",
       "5.  Existing sample table entries (corresponding to S1-A1 to S1-A6) were copied [00:00:21]-[00:00:22] and pasted into new lines [00:00:24]-[00:00:25].\n",
       "6.  ❌ **Error:** Sample IDs for the new rows were adjusted between [00:00:29]-[00:00:40], but the specified protocol pattern (`currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_sampleName`) was not strictly adhered to (e.g., `20250314_TIMS03Resp_PaSa_MA_HeLa_ddaPASEF_1400V_AJPon`).\n",
       "7.  A sequence recommended for performance evaluation was queued: 1 blank, 3 dda-PASEF runs, 3 dia-PASEF runs, and 1 final blank, based on the adjusted Sample IDs and MS Methods [00:00:29]-[00:00:40], [01:14:00]. The sequence started with a blank.\n",
       "8.  The column autocompletion ('Tray Configuration') settings were checked by right-clicking a 'Vial' field [00:00:49], selecting 'Configure...', confirming settings (arrows right, type 'Evosep', slots '96evotip') [00:00:50], and clicking 'OK' [00:00:51].\n",
       "9.  The Evotip positions were matched to the sample locations by individually selecting the correct vial positions (S1 A1-A6 and S3 A1-A6) from the dropdown menu in the 'Vial' column for each new row [00:00:45]-[01:02:00]. Autofill was not used for this column.\n",
       "10. A 'Data Path' was specified for the new rows by copying an existing path using the drag-fill feature [00:00:42].\n",
       "11. An existing 'Separation Method' ('VHvaperRj\\_zoom') was chosen by copying it to the new rows using drag-fill [00:00:43].\n",
       "12. The 'Injection Method' was set to 'Standard' by copying it to the new rows using drag-fill [00:00:44].\n",
       "13. Appropriate 'MS Methods' (dda-PASEF, dia-PASEF, and blank maintenance methods) were loaded for the new rows by copying/drag-filling from existing rows [01:13:00]-[01:14:00].\n",
       "14. ❌ **Omitted:** Stopping the idle flow on the Evosep via the HyStar interface was not performed.\n",
       "15. The modified sample table was saved by clicking the 'Save changes' icon [01:18:00].\n",
       "16. The newly defined sample table entries (rows S1-A7 to S2-A6) were selected [01:21:00], right-clicked, and 'Upload Sample Conditions' was selected [01:22:00]. The status updated to 'Sample data loaded' [01:23:00]-[01:28:00].\n",
       "17. The measurement sequence was initiated by clicking the 'Start' button dropdown [01:29:00] and selecting 'Start Sequence' [01:30:00]. Acquisition began for the first sample [01:31:00].\n",

To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",

       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",

       "7.  ❌ **Error:** Four new runs were queued (two sample runs at S1-A1, S1-A2; two blank runs at S3-A1, S3-A2). This differed from the recommended structure (1 blank, 3 DDA, 3 DIA, 1 blank). The sequence of newly added runs was initiated with a sample run (S1-A1) [01:15], not a blank run as recommended in the critical step of the ground truth protocol.\n",
       "8.  ❌ **Omitted:** The column autocompletion settings were not explicitly verified via the 'Configure' menu. However, the autofill function was used [00:00:30], [00:00:43].\n",
       "9.  The Evotip positions ('Vial' column) for the new runs were set to S1-A1, S1-A2, S3-A1, and S3-A2, using dropdown selection for the first position of each pair and the drag/autofill function for the second position [00:00:26]-[00:00:30], [00:00:36]-[00:00:43].\n",

       "11. ❌ **Omitted:** The 'Separation Method' was not explicitly chosen, created, or verified for the new rows; the values appeared to be carried over from the copied template rows.\n",
       "12. ❌ **Omitted:** The 'Injection Method' ('Standard') was not explicitly set or verified for the new rows; the value appeared to be carried over from the copied template rows.\n",

       "14. ❌ **Omitted:** The action to stop an idle flow on the Evosep ('Cancel maintenance procedure') was not performed. The system status displayed a low flow rate, potentially indicating it was not in an idle state requiring this action [00:01:18].\n",
       "15. The sample table was saved using the 'Save As...' function [00:01:00]-[00:01:02].\n",
       "16. The four new sample rows were selected, right-clicked, and 'Upload Sample Conditions' was chosen. The status changed from 'loading' to 'sample data loaded' [00:01:03]-[00:01:11].\n",

       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
