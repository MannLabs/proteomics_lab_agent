       "|-----------|--------|-------------|\n",
       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes maintained the relevant sections: Aim, Materials (Equipment, Reagents, Reagent setup), Procedure, and Results. This structure aligns well with the benchmark's structure (Aim, Materials, Procedure, Results), with minor acceptable enhancements in the Materials sub-sections. |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense throughout the Procedure and Results sections to describe what actually happened (e.g., \"was visually inspected,\" \"were placed,\" \"was not observed\"). This meets the criterion fully. |\n",
       "| Language | Excellent | The AI successfully removed instructional language and replaced it with observational statements. For example, \"Visually inspect...\" from a protocol becomes \"The Evotip box... was visually inspected...\" in the lab notes. This is consistent with good lab note practice. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI maintained the step numbering (1-7) from its reference protocol (\"Ground truth written protocol (transcribed)\") in the Procedure section. It also appropriately noted an \"➕ Added\" observation (step 4.1) and a \"❌ Omitted\" step (step 7), which is a clear and effective way to handle deviations or additional observations, similar in spirit to the benchmark's notation of deviations. |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI included specific, actual timing for the procedure: \"*Timing: The observed procedure took approximately 50 seconds (from [00:00:03]... to [00:00:53]...)*\". This is superior to an estimated timing and directly meets the criterion. The benchmark, for comparison, provided an estimated timing (\"less than 1 minute\") in its procedure. |"

       "| Structure | Good      | The AI successfully kept the essential sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results. The \"Materials\" section was slightly restructured by adding a \"Reagents\" subsection, which is an acceptable variation. However, the \"Aim\" section in the AI-generated notes (\"This protocol detailed the procedure for...\") described the general purpose of the input protocol document rather than stating the specific experimental objective of the lab session (e.g., specific samples or target positions), which was more clearly defined in the benchmark's Aim. |\n",
       "| Tense     | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense throughout the Procedure and Results sections to accurately describe what was observed and performed (e.g., \"was visually inspected,\" \"were placed,\" \"were observed\"). This aligns with the requirement to describe what actually happened.                                                                                  |\n",

The descriptions are based on observed actions.                                        |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI maintained the step numbering (1-7) from the original protocol in its Procedure section. It correctly identified and noted deviations from the protocol (an error in step 6 and an omission in step 7) while preserving the original numbering structure.                                                                                                    |\n",
       "| Timing    | Excellent | The AI included specific timing information. It provided an overall duration (\"Approximately 48 seconds for core actions and confirmation\") and also embedded precise timestamps for individual actions within the procedure steps (e.g., \"[00:00:03] - [00:00:08]\"). This fulfills the requirement for exact actual timing, surpassing the benchmark's estimated timing. |"

       "\n",
       "1. Visually inspect the Evotip box intended for S1 to verify it's filled with Buffer A solution to a minimum depth of 1 cm. Verification of the Evotip box placed at S3 is not necessary as it will only contain blanks.\n",
       "2. Place Evotip Box at S1 within the rack system of the Evosep instrument. Ensure each box is firmly seated in its designated position.\n",
       "3. Place an empty Evotip Box for Blank tips at S3. Ensure each box is firmly seated in its designated position.\n",
       "4. Inspect each Evotip before placement to verify its condition. Properly prepared Evotips should display a pale-colored SPE material disc with visible solvent above it (Figure 2).\n",
       "   **CRITICAL STEP**: Discard any Evotips showing signs of dryness or displaying a white-colored disc, as these conditions indicate compromised functionality that could affect sample analysis.\n",
       "5. Place the verified Evotips into the prepared Evotip boxes at S1 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "6. Place empty Evotips, called Blanks, at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "7. Document the precise position of each placed Evotip.\n",

       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes retained all the relevant sections: Aim, Materials (with appropriate sub-sections for Equipment, Reagents, and Reagent setup), Procedure, and Results, fully aligning with the standard lab note structure. |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense throughout the Procedure and Results sections (e.g., \"was not performed,\" \"was placed,\" \"were seated\") to accurately describe what actually happened during the experiment. |\n",
       "| Language | Good | The AI successfully removed instructional language from the Procedure and Results sections, replacing it with clear observations (e.g., \"Visual inspection ... was not performed,\" \"Unverified Evotips were placed\"). The \"Materials\" section includes a \"CAUTION\" note about Formic Acid, which, while a warning, is informational about the material's properties rather than a procedural instruction and is generally acceptable. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI maintained the step numbering (1-7) from the original protocol (\"STEP 1: Ground truth written protocol\") in its Procedure section. It correctly indicated omitted steps and used clear sub-numbering (e.g., 5.1, 5.2) for actions that were observed but not part of the original protocol. |\n",
       "| Timing | Good | The AI included an overall duration of \"*Timing: Approximately 37 seconds*\". While \"Approximately\" is a slight hedge, the video ends at 00:00:37, making 37 seconds the actual observed duration. More importantly, the AI provided exact actual timestamps for individual actions and observations within the Procedure section (e.g., \"00:00:01 - 00:00:03,\" \"00:00:12\"), fulfilling the requirement for detailed timing. |"

While the AI's Results section does capture these specifics, the benchmark's style of Aim is often more direct for lab notes.

It also effectively noted deviations from the protocol (e.g., \"❌ Error:\", \"❌ Omitted:\") based on its observations. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI maintained the primary step numbering (1-7) corresponding to the original protocol's main actions. It incorporated additional, more granular observed actions as sub-steps using a clear decimal numbering system (e.g., 0.1, 2.1), which were marked as \"➕ Added\". This preserved the original sequence and numbering for primary steps. |\n",
       "| Timing    | Excellent | The AI included exact actual timing. It provided an overall duration for the procedure (\"*Timing: Approximately 53 seconds*\") and also included specific timestamps for individual actions within the Procedure section (e.g., \"(00:00:04)\"). This is more precise than the benchmark's estimated overall timing (\"*Timing: less than 1 minute*\"). |"

       "1. In timsControl, verfy if the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standy by mode (Figure 1).\n",
       "2. Verify that the syringe is inactive in the tab 'Source' under 'Syringe Pump'. If not click on 'Stop'.\n",

       "### Remove ESI source\n",
       "4. At the instrument, disconnect the peak connector of the sample tubing (Figure 2).\n",
       "5. Disconnect the nebulizer N₂ line.\n",
       "6. Remove the ESI source housing by hinging it out like a regular door.\n",

       "11. Hinge the UltraSource door in and close it (Figure 3).\n",
       "12. Slide the UltraSource housing onto the source door and secure it by flipping the handles located at the top right and bottom left by 180°.\n",
       "13. Connect the filter tubing to the source.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Connect column and sample line\n",
       "14. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.\n",
       "15. Verify if the LC sample line has a black NanoViper adapter attached. If not, locate an adapter and securely attach it to the sample line.\n",
       "16. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\n",
       "17. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\n",
       "18. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 3).\n",
       "   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n",
       "19. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\n",
       "20. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\n",

       "22. Close the lid of the oven.\n",
       "23. Connect the oven to the electrical power supply.\n",
       "24. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blincking light indicates that the oven is heating up.\n",
       "    CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.\n",

       "### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\n",
       "25. In timsCOntrol, activate the CaptiveSpray function in timsControl (Figure 1)\n",
       "26. Transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\n",
       "27. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
       "28. Return to timsControl and check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\n",
       "29. Monitor the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. The funnel pressur is acceptable within a 9-11 mbar range. Aim for a 10 mbar funnel pressure. Adjust the 'funnel pressure' wheel if necessary by turning counter clock-wise to reduce the pressure.\n",

It includes only the relevant sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results, exactly matching the structure of the benchmark lab notes.                                                  |\n",
       "| Tense     | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense in its generated lab notes (STEP 4) to describe actions that occurred. For example, \"the instrument was initially in 'Operating' mode,\" \"The PEEK connector...was disconnected,\" \"The researcher was wearing laboratory gloves.\" This aligns with the benchmark's use of past tense (e.g., \"verified,\" \"disconnected\"). |\n",
       "| Language  | Excellent | The AI successfully removed all instructional language (present in its \"STEP 1\" understanding of the protocol, e.g., \"Verify if...\") and replaced it with factual, observational language in the past tense in its \"STEP 4\" lab notes (e.g., \"Verified that the syringe was inactive...\"). It accurately documents what was observed in the video, including deviations, errors, and omissions, which is key for lab notes. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI maintained the step numbering (1-29) from the original protocol (as represented in its \"STEP 1\" and consistent with the benchmark's procedure section) in its \"STEP 4\" lab notes. This was done even when noting changes in order (Step 3) or omitted steps (Steps 16, 27), fulfilling the criterion. |\n",
       "| Timing    | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes (STEP 4) included exact actual timing. It provided an overall duration (\"Timing: Approximately 3 minutes 53 seconds\") derived from the video and also included specific timestamps (e.g., \"[00:00:13]\") for individual actions within the procedure steps. This meets the requirement of using actual, not estimated, timing. |"

       "1. In timsControl, verfy if the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standy by mode (Figure 1).\n",
       "2. Verify that the syringe is inactive in the tab 'Source' under 'Syringe Pump'. If not click on 'Stop'.\n",
       "3. In the 'source' and 'source type' sections of timsControl, choose 'CaptiveSpray' but do not activate it yet.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Remove ESI source\n",
       "4. At the instrument, disconnect the peak connector of the sample tubing (Figure 2).\n",
       "5. Disconnect the nebulizer N₂ line.\n",
       "6. Remove the ESI source housing by hinging it out like a regular door.\n",

       "   ! CAUTION: The capillary cap is hot.\n",
       "10. Inspect the capillary position. If it appears to be partially pulled out, gently push it back into proper position without blocking the gas flow.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Mount UltraSource\n",
       "11. Hinge the UltraSource door in and close it (Figure 3).\n",
       "12. Slide the UltraSource housing onto the source door and secure it by flipping the handles located at the top right and bottom left by 180°.\n",
       "13. Connect the filter tubing to the source.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Connect column and sample line\n",
       "14. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.\n",
       "15. Verify if the LC sample line has a black NanoViper adapter attached. If not, locate an adapter and securely attach it to the sample line.\n",
       "16. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\n",
       "17. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\n",
       "18. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 3).\n",
       "   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n",
       "19. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\n",
       "20. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\n",
       "21. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\n",
       "22. Close the lid of the oven.\n",
       "23. Connect the oven to the electrical power supply.\n",
       "24. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blincking light indicates that the oven is heating up.\n",
       "    CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\n",
       "25. In timsCOntrol, activate the CaptiveSpray function in timsControl (Figure 1)\n",
       "26. Transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\n",
       "27. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
       "28. Return to timsControl and check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\n",
       "29. Monitor the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. The funnel pressur is acceptable within a 9-11 mbar range. Aim for a 10 mbar funnel pressure. Adjust the 'funnel pressure' wheel if necessary by turning counter clock-wise to reduce the pressure.\n",

       "| Numbering | Poor | The AI maintained original step numbers for descriptions but listed procedure steps in the original protocol's numerical sequence in its \"Resulting Lab Notes\" (STEP 4). It did not reorder the steps in its list to reflect the actual chronological order of execution if it had differed from the protocol. The benchmark, in contrast, demonstrates best practice by reordering steps in the list (e.g., listing protocol step 29 before step 26, or step 20 before 19) to accurately represent the observed execution flow, while still using the original step numbers. The AI's approach would fail to clearly represent a changed order of operations in the way the benchmark does. |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI provided an exact actual timing for the procedure (\"3 minutes 38 seconds (total video duration)\") in its lab notes (STEP 4), which is an actual observed timing and replaces any estimated timing from a protocol, aligning with the criterion. |"

       "# Change source: UltraSource to ESI source\n",
       "\n",
       "## Aim\n",
       "This protocol documented the procedure for switching from the UltraSource to the ESI source on the timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Materials\n",
       "\n",
       "### Equipment\n",
       "- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer:\n",
       "  - Initially equipped with an UltraSource ion source.\n",
       "  - Apollo ESI source available for attachment.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Procedure\n",
       "*Timing: Approximately 3 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch TimsControl to 'Standby' mode\n",
       "1.  ⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order** The UltraSource, presumably with an integrated column, was observed to be connected at the start of the procedure [00:00:00-00:00:03]. Verification of column disconnection from an Evosep system *prior* to placing the TimsControl software into standby mode was not explicitly performed.\n",
       "2.  ⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order** The TimsControl software was initially in 'Operating' mode [00:00:03-00:00:08]. It was then actively switched to 'Standby' mode by the researcher [00:00:08-00:00:13], rather than verifying a pre-existing standby state.\n",
       "3.  During the transition to 'Standby' mode, a \"Change Source\" dialog appeared, within which the 'ESI' source type was implicitly selected or confirmed [00:00:08-00:00:13]. The ESI source was not activated at this time.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Remove UltraSource\n",
       "4.  The power supply for the column oven on the UltraSource was disconnected by unscrewing and removing its connector [00:00:18-00:00:24].\n",
       "5.  The filter tubing (white corrugated tube) was disconnected from the UltraSource [00:00:24-00:00:26].\n",
       "6.  The top right and bottom left handles of the UltraSource housing were rotated by approximately 180 degrees [00:00:27-00:00:39].\n",
       "7.  The UltraSource housing was slid off from both the source door and the glass capillary [00:00:39-00:00:42].\n",
       "8.  The UltraSource housing was set on the bench [00:00:42-00:00:45].\n",
       "9.  The source door was removed by opening it and unhinging it from the instrument [00:00:47-00:00:52].\n",
       "10. The source door was set aside on the bench [00:00:52-00:00:56].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Mount Apollo ESI source\n",
       "11. Gloves were put on by the researcher [00:00:56-00:00:58], having been picked up at [00:00:45].\n",
       "12. The capillary cap was securely attached to the glass capillary by screwing it on [01:00:01-01:00:07].\n",
       "13. ❌ **Omitted:** The step to attach a separate spray shield to the desolvation stage housing was not observed. The Apollo ESI source appeared to be mounted as a complete unit.\n",
       "14. The ESI source housing was hinged into position on the instrument and closed by securing its latch [01:00:10-01:00:20].\n",
       "15. The sample inlet red PEEK tubing line was connected to the ESI source by turning its fitting clockwise [01:00:20-01:00:36].\n",
       "16. The nebulizer gas inlet (transparent/white tube) was connected to the N₂ line port on the ESI source [01:00:36-01:00:49].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Prepare the setup by loading the syringe with Tuning Mix\n",
       "17. Old solvent was removed from the syringe by expelling it into a waste container in a fume hood [01:00:51-01:56:00].\n",
       "18. New Tuning Mix liquid was withdrawn into the syringe from a bottle labeled \"Tuning Mix ESI\" [01:56:00-02:05:00].\n",
       "19. The syringe was ensured to be devoid of air bubbles by flicking and expelling a small priming volume [02:05:00-02:12:00].\n",
       "20. The syringe was connected to the red PEEK tubing of the sample line [02:18:00-02:26:00].\n",
       "21. The syringe was mounted within the external syringe pump setup [02:26:00-02:32:00].\n",
       "22. ❌ **Omitted:** The step to manually press some solvent out of the syringe to fill the sample line *after* mounting on the pump and *before* software-initiated flow was not observed.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch TimsControl to 'Operate' mode\n",
       "23. The ESI source was activated within the TimsControl software by clicking \"Activate Source\" on the \"Change Source\" pop-up [02:36:00-02:39:00].\n",
       "24. The instrument was transitioned into 'Operate' mode by clicking on the on/off symbol in the software [02:39:00-02:42:00]; the status indicator changed from red (Standby) to green (Operating).\n",
       "25. Flow was initiated from the syringe pump via the TimsControl software. The settings displayed were: Syringe: Hamilton 500 µL; Flow Rate: 3 µL/min. The \"Start\" button was pressed [02:42:00]. A signal was subsequently observed in the 'Chromatogram View' and 'TIMS View' windows [02:42:00-02:59:00].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Results\n",
       "At the conclusion of the procedure [02:59:00], a signal was observed in the TimsControl software ('Chromatogram View' and 'TIMS View' windows), indicating successful ESI source operation and sample introduction. Specific signal intensity values were not recorded as part of this observation."

       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes (referred to as \"STEP 4\" in its output) correctly adhered to the required structure, including only the relevant sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results, matching the benchmark. |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense throughout the \"Procedure\" and \"Results\" sections to describe actions that were performed and observations made (e.g., \"was disconnected,\" \"were put on,\" \"was observed\"). This aligns with the benchmark's use of past tense. |\n",
       "| Language | Excellent | The AI successfully removed instructional language and replaced it with clear, observational statements. It effectively noted deviations from the protocol (e.g., \"⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order**\") and omitted steps (e.g., \"❌ **Omitted:**\"), similar to the benchmark's style but with added descriptive context. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI maintained the step numbering from the original protocol (as presented in its \"STEP 1\" and aligned with the benchmark's implicit procedural flow) within its \"Procedure\" section. Deviations and omissions were noted against the original step numbers, ensuring clarity and traceability. |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI included exact actual timing. It provided an overall procedure time (\"Approximately 3 minutes\") based on the video evidence, which is an actual timing. It also included specific timestamps for individual steps and key observations (e.g., signal appearance \"[02:42:00-02:59:00]\"), fulfilling the criterion more thoroughly than the benchmark's estimated overall timing. |"

Additionally, it includes specific timestamps within the procedure section for many individual actions and observations (e.g., \"[00:00:09]\", \"[00:01:24]\", \"[00:03:07]\"), fulfilling the requirement for exact actual timing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |"

       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",

       "2.  **It was followed correctly:** The \"lock\" icon associated with the 1/K₀ end parameter was activated [00:00:06 - 00:00:11].\n",
       "3.  **It was followed correctly:** The 1/K₀ start value was adjusted from 0.70 V.s/cm² to 0.85 V.s/cm². This action, with the lock active, resulted in the 1/K₀ end value automatically changing to 1.45 V.s/cm², thereby shifting the ion mobility range to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀ [00:00:11 - 00:00:21].\n",
       "4.  **It was followed correctly:** The Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) displayed in the Chromatogram View was observed to be stable prior to proceeding with subsequent steps [00:00:21 - 00:00:25].\n",
       "5.  **It was followed correctly:** The scan mode was switched from \"dia-PASEF\" to \"MS\" [00:00:25 - 00:00:27]. Subsequently, the MS averaging parameter was set to 30 [00:00:27 - 00:00:31], and the polygon heatmap visualization filter was deactivated [00:00:31 - 00:00:37].\n",
       "6.  **It was followed correctly:** Navigation to the 'Calibration' section was performed, with the 'Mobility' sub-tab being automatically selected [00:00:37 - 00:00:40].\n",
       "7.  **It was followed correctly:** The reference list named '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF CCS compendium (ESI)', which includes calibrant masses 622, 922, and 1221 m/z, was confirmed as selected [00:00:40 - 00:00:42].\n",

       "11. **It was followed correctly:** An adjustment to the picked center for the 1221.9906 m/z calibrant was made by clicking directly on its peak in the TIMS view window, which resulted in an improved calibration score [00:01:00 - 00:01:08].\n",

       "13. **It was followed correctly:** The original acquisition method was reloaded by selecting \"Method\" > \"Load Recent\", choosing the same method file, and then selecting \"Discard changes\" in the confirmation pop-up window. This reverted the ion mobility and scan mode settings to their pre-calibration values [00:01:13 - 00:01:21].\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4.  Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5.  Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6.  In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7.  **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8.  Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9.  Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",

       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense throughout the Procedure and Results sections to describe what was observed or performed in the video (e.g., \"was observed\", \"was switched\", \"reached\"). |\n",
       "| Language | Excellent | The AI successfully converted instructional language from its input protocol (\"STEP 1: 'Ground truth written protocol'\") into observational statements in its lab notes (e.g., \"The scan mode was switched...\" instead of \"Switch the scan mode...\"). |\n",
       "| Numbering | Poor | The AI maintained the step numbering from its input protocol. However, when compared to the Benchmark Lab Notes (Ground Truth), the content described under corresponding step numbers differs significantly for early steps. For instance, Benchmark Step 1 describes verifying/setting a 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ range, and Benchmark Step 3 describes adjusting this to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The AI's Lab Note Step 1 describes the 0.85-1.45 1/K₀ range as already existing, and its Step 3 confirms no adjustment was made. This means the AI's lab note does not reflect the initial procedural actions implied by the benchmark's numbering, instead documenting them as pre-existing conditions. |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI included actual timing information derived from the video: an overall duration (\"approximately 49 seconds\") and specific timestamps for individual actions within the procedural steps. This correctly replaces any estimated timings from the input protocol. |"

       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",

       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4.  Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5.  Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6.  In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7.  **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8.  Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9.  Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",

This action ensured that the subsequent adjustment of 1/K0 start would lead to a recalculation of 1/K0 end to maintain the interval if that's the software behavior, or allow independent setting.

       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes (AI-LN) correctly include and are limited to the relevant sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results, mirroring the structure of the benchmark ground truth (GT). It appropriately omits sections like Abstract, Figures, or References that were present in the original protocol document.                                                                                                                                                              |\n",
       "| Tense     | Good      | The AI-LN predominantly uses the past tense to describe actions and observations in the Procedure and Results sections (e.g., \"method was already loaded,\" \"scan mode was switched,\" \"score was 99.83%\"). However, the Aim section (\"This protocol detailed the calibration... The calibration was recommended...\") uses past tense to describe the *source protocol/video* rather than stating the *experiment's aim* in the past tense (e.g., \"The aim was to calibrate...\"). This misapplication makes the Aim section weak, leading to a \"Good\" rating. |\n",
       "| Language  | Good      | The AI-LN successfully removes instructional language (e.g., \"Use timsControl to load...\") from the original protocol and replaces it with observations of what occurred (e.g., \"...method...was already loaded...\"). This is well executed in the Procedure and Results. The Aim section, while observational (\"This protocol detailed...\"), makes observations about the source document instead of observing/stating the actual experimental purpose. This makes the Aim section's language choice suboptimal for its intended function, thus meriting a \"Good\" rating. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI-LN maintains the step numbering of the original protocol (steps 1-14) for corresponding experimental events. Additional actions or repetitions observed (e.g., related to calibration and verification) are clearly denoted with sub-numbering (e.g., 9.1, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4), linking them logically to the original step numbers. The AI-LN presents events chronologically as per its interpretation, and its numbering reflects this consistently. |\n",
       "| Timing    | Excellent | The AI-LN includes exact actual timing information, not estimated timings. It provides an overall duration (\"*Timing: 1 minute 20 seconds (total video duration)*\") and duration for a specific sub-step (\"observed for approximately 4 seconds\"). Furthermore, it includes specific timestamps (e.g., \"[00:00:12]-[00:00:16]\") for many actions, adhering to the requirement for actual timing. This contrasts with the \"Estimated timing\" found in the original protocol. |"

       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",

       "1. Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3. In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4. Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9. Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",

       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes (referred to as \"STEP 4: Resulting Lab Notes\" in the AI's output) correctly included only the relevant sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results. This matches the structure of the benchmark lab notes. |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used past tense throughout the Procedure and Results sections of its STEP 4 notes (e.g., \"was navigated to,\" \"were adjusted,\" \"was started\"). This accurately reflects that the notes describe events that have already occurred, as observed in the video. |\n",
       "| Language | Excellent | The AI's STEP 4 notes effectively removed instructional language (e.g., \"Verify,\" \"Adjust\") and replaced it with observational statements (e.g., \"It was stated that...\",\"The sample IDs... were adjusted...\"). The language describes what actually happened based on the video. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI's STEP 4 Procedure maintained the 17-step numbering that corresponds to the 17 steps in the benchmark lab notes' Procedure section. The content of each AI-generated step thematically aligns with the corresponding step in the benchmark. |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI's STEP 4 notes included an exact actual timing for the documented actions: \"Timing: 01 minutes 58 seconds (for the recorded portion of the procedure)\". This timing is based on the video evidence and is not an estimated timing. Additionally, timestamps were provided for individual actions within the procedure steps. |"

       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",

The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3. In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4. Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9. Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Expected Results\n",

       "|-----------|--------|-------------|\n",
       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes (specifically, \"STEP 4: Resulting lab notes\") correctly maintained only the relevant sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results, mirroring the structure of the benchmark lab notes. |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes consistently used the past tense in the Procedure section to describe what actually happened (e.g., \"samples *were placed*\", \"device *had already been calibrated*\", \"entries *were selected, copied, and pasted*\"), which aligns with the benchmark's usage. |\n",
       "| Language | Poor | While the AI successfully removed instructional language and adopted an observational style, the content of these observations in the AI's \"Resulting lab notes\" (STEP 4) has significant factual discrepancies when compared to the benchmark (ground truth). Key examples include: <br>1. **Step 7 (Queue Composition)**: The benchmark states \"Queued three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs, but missed to queue a blank at the start and end...\". The AI describes a different composition for the 6 new samples (1 blank, 2 dda, 1 dia, 1 blank, 1 dia) and doesn't mention the missed blanks at queue start/end. <br>2. **Step 8 (Autocompletion Settings)**: The benchmark states \"Values were set to autocomplete from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right.\" The AI's lab note states \"Autocompletion arrows were set to downwards\". <br>3. **Step 13 (MS Method Error)**: The benchmark notes an error: \"the last three samples would have to be linked to a dia-PASEF maintenance method.\" The AI's lab note does not report this error, stating only that MS methods \"were loaded via the copied entries\". <br>4. **Step 16 (Upload Sample Conditions)**: The benchmark explicitly states this step was \"❌ Omitted: Missed to right-click... The status did not changed to loaded.\" The AI's lab note contrarily states this step was performed and \"The status of the new lines changed to 'Loaded'\". <br>These substantial deviations mean the AI's \"observations\" do not accurately reflect the ground truth presented in the benchmark. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes (\"STEP 4: Resulting lab notes\") maintained the step numbering of the original protocol (as presented in the AI's \"STEP 1\" and used by the benchmark). Each numbered point in the AI's procedure corresponds to the equivalent step number from the original protocol, and it describes the observed actions for that step, including noting deviations in order where applicable (e.g., step 16). |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes included specific, actual timing information. It provided an overall duration (\"Timing: Approximately 1 minute 18 seconds of active work shown in the video...\") derived from its analysis, not an estimated timing. Furthermore, it included timestamps for individual actions within the procedure (e.g., \"([00:00:01]-[00:00:15])\"), which is a good practice. This meets the criterion of using exact actual timing. |"

       "## Procedure\n",
       "*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3. In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4. Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9. Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Expected Results\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3. In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4. Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9. Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",

       "| Criterion | Rating | Explanation |\n",
       "|-----------|--------|-------------|\n",
       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes (STEP 4) maintained the relevant sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results, consistent with the benchmark lab notes. It did not include extraneous sections from the input protocol (e.g., Abstract, Figures, References from STEP 1 of the AI's process). |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense throughout the Procedure and Results sections to describe what was actually observed and performed (e.g., \"Verification...was confirmed\", \"An existing sample table...was selected\", \"The HyStar software indicated...\"). This aligns with standard lab note practices. |\n",
       "| Language | Good | The AI successfully replaced instructional language from the reference protocol with observational statements (e.g., \"Verification of Evotip placement was confirmed verbally...\" instead of \"Verify Evotip placement...\"). It also clearly marked \"Omitted\" steps with \"❌ **Omitted:**\". However, it did not explicitly flag other deviations from the protocol (e.g., step 7, where the number of dia runs and final blanks differed from the protocol's recommendation) with an \"❌ **Error:**\" tag as seen in the benchmark. While the observation itself was recorded, the lack of explicit error tagging for such deviations is a minor issue when compared to the benchmark's style. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI maintained the step numbering (1-17) from the original protocol (referenced in its STEP 1) in its Procedure section. This numbering was preserved even for steps that were documented as \"Omitted,\" mirroring the practice in the benchmark lab notes. |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI included exact actual timing. It provided an overall duration for the observed procedure (\"Approximately 1 minute 32 seconds (duration of video)\") and, crucially, included specific timestamps for individual actions within each step of the Procedure (e.g., \"(00:00:00 - 00:00:09)\"). This is more detailed and precise than the benchmark's single overall timing. |"

       "| Criterion | Rating | Explanation |\n",
       "|-----------|--------|-------------|\n",
       "| Structure | Good | The AI maintained the primary sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results, as seen in the benchmark. However, its \"Materials\" section included an additional \"Reagents\" sub-section which detailed \"Formic acid (FA)\" along with a \"CAUTION\" notice. This CAUTION notice was not present in the benchmark's more concise \"Materials\" section (which only had \"Equipment\" and \"Reagent setup\"). This makes the AI's structure deviate by incorporating safety warnings more typical of an original SOP rather than the benchmark's observation-focused lab notes. |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense to describe all actions, states, and observations. For example, \"The aim was to pipette...\", \"Adjusted the pipette...\", \"Buffer A consisted of...\", and \"liquid was dispensed...\" are all in the past tense, fully meeting the criterion. |\n",
       "| Language | Poor | While the Procedure section largely used observational language correctly (e.g., \"Dispensed 20 μL of Buffer A...\", \"Wells A11 and A12 were skipped...\"), the AI's \"Materials\" section included a \"CAUTION\" notice: \"! CAUTION: This liquid may be corrosive. It is harmful and can cause damage if direct contact occurs.\" This is instructional/warning language, not an observation from the experiment, and was not present in the benchmark lab notes. This inclusion represents a failure to remove all instructional language and replace it purely with observations. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI successfully maintained the step numbering of the original protocol, even when the order of steps was altered (e.g., step 2 was performed and listed before step 1, matching the benchmark's approach). It also correctly marked deviations and errors. Added steps observed but not in the original protocol (6.1, 6.2) were given new, distinct numbers, which is a logical extension. |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI included specific, actual timing information based on its observations. It reported the overall procedure duration as \"approximately 1 minute and 12 seconds,\" which was derived from observed video timestamps and correctly replaced any \"Estimated timing\" from an original protocol. Additionally, the AI provided timestamps for individual procedural steps (e.g., \"[00:00:06] - [00:00:10]\"), offering a more detailed account of timing than the benchmark's single duration note. |"

       "| Criterion | Rating | Explanation |\n",
       "|-----------|--------|-------------|\n",
       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI's lab notes maintained all the relevant sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results, consistent with the benchmark's structure. Sub-sections within Materials were also appropriately kept. |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense (e.g., \"was pipetted,\" \"was observed,\" \"was not mixed\") to describe the actions performed, which aligns with the benchmark's use of past tense (e.g., \"Opened,\" \"Pipetted,\" \"Did not mix\"). |\n",
       "| Language | Poor | While the AI used an observational style, its recorded observations regarding critical experimental actions significantly contradict the benchmark (ground truth). For example, the AI states \"400 μL of Buffer A was pipetted\" and \"The Eppendorf tube was labeled,\" whereas the benchmark records \"Pipetted 400 μL of Buffer B\" (as an error) and \"Did not label the Eppendorf tube.\" This failure to record the correct observations as per the ground truth makes the language criterion poorly met. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Poor | The AI's step numbering in the Procedure refers to a sequence of events and specific actions (e.g., pipetting Buffer A at its step 4) that do not match the events described in the benchmark (e.g., pipetting Buffer B at its step 4). Because the AI's documented actions differ significantly from the benchmark's, its numbering does not correctly correspond to the ground truth protocol steps or their content. |\n",
       "| Timing | Poor | The AI includes specific timestamps for its observed actions. However, these actions (e.g., correct pipetting of Buffers A then B, labeling the tube) are substantially different from those in the benchmark (errors in pipetting, no labeling). Therefore, the AI does not provide the actual timing for the events that occurred in the benchmark experiment; the timings provided are for a different, erroneously documented procedure. While the overall duration of \"1 minute\" matches, this is insufficient given the discrepancy in the described actions. |"

       "## Procedure\n",
       "*Timing: The centrifuge run was set for 1 minute; preparation and setup took additional time.*\n",
       "\n",
       "0.1. ➕ **Added:** The researcher began by stating the intention to spin Evotips and the need to balance them (00:00:00 - 00:00:01).\n",
       "0.2. ➕ **Added:** The researcher verbally confirmed the spinning parameters: \"Then it should be spun at 800g for 1 minute\" (00:00:10).\n",
       "1.  ❌ **Error:** & ⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order** An attempt to distribute Evotips was made by using a multichannel pipette to transfer tips from one source box to another destination Evotip box (00:00:02 - 00:00:06). However, instead of preparing two \"Evotip holders\" with a specific count like 12 Evotips each, the researcher ultimately selected two full Evotip *boxes* (00:00:09) for the centrifugation. These boxes were placed into centrifuge adapters, effectively serving as the \"holders\" for balancing. The specified \"Evotip holders with solvent reservoir\" were not used as described.\n",
       "2.  ❌ **Error:** The centrifuge was already on, as indicated by the illuminated screen when the lid was opened (00:00:22). The step of switching on the centrifuge was not observed.\n",
       "3.  The two Evotip boxes, each placed within a white centrifuge adapter (00:00:18), were then placed into the centrifuge rotor at opposite positions to ensure balance (00:00:23-00:00:24).\n",
       "3.1. ➕ **Added:** The centrifuge lid was opened by the researcher (00:00:22).\n",
       "3.2. ➕ **Added:** The centrifuge parameters were configured via the touchscreen: speed was set to 800 xg, time to 1 minute, and temperature to 25°C. These settings were saved (00:00:25 - 00:00:29).\n",
       "3.3. ➕ **Added:** The centrifuge lid was closed (00:00:30).\n",
       "4.  The centrifuge run was initiated by pressing the \"Start\" button (00:00:33). The Evotips commenced spinning at the set 800 xg for 1 minute. The video recording concluded at 00:00:50, while the centrifuge was still in operation with 44 seconds remaining on the timer and the RCF at 597 xg and still increasing towards the target of 800 xg.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Results\n",
       "Two full Evotip boxes were used for balancing and were placed in a Thermo Scientific Multifuge X Pro Series centrifuge. The centrifuge was programmed to spin at 800 xg for 1 minute at 25°C. The run was successfully started, and the centrifuge was operating as expected when the video ended prematurely."

The AI states the Evotips were spun at 800g, but the benchmark specifies they were spun at 700g. This discrepancy in a critical experimental parameter constitutes a significant issue with the recorded \"observation.\" |\n",

It appropriately incorporated newly observed actions or sub-steps with additional clear numbering (e.g., 0.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) without disrupting the core protocol's numerical flow. |\n",
       "| Timing    | Excellent | The AI included exact actual timing. It correctly reported the set centrifuge run time (\"1 minute\") and enhanced the notes by providing specific timestamps from the video for various actions (e.g., \"00:00:25 - 00:00:29\" for parameter configuration). This is an improvement over estimated timings. |"
