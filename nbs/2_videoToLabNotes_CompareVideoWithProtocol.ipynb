CAUTION: This liquid may be corrosive. It is harmful and can cause damage if direct contact occurs.\\n\\n### Reagent setup\\n- Buffer A: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA. The buffers are stable for at least 6 months at room temperature as long as they are protected from sunlight.\\n\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: less than 1 minute*\\n\\n1. Verify that Evotip box is filled to a minimum depth of 1 cm with Buffer A solution.\\n2. Place Evotip Box at S1 within the rack system of the Evosep instrument. Ensure each box is firmly seated in its designated position.\\n3. Place an empty Evotip Box for Blank tips at S3. Ensure each box is firmly seated in its designated position.\\n4. Inspect each Evotip before placement to verify its condition. Properly prepared Evotips should display a pale-colored SPE material disc with visible solvent above it (Figure 2).\\n   **CRITICAL STEP**: Discard any Evotips showing signs of dryness or displaying a white-colored disc, as these conditions indicate compromised functionality that could affect sample analysis.\\n5. Place the verified Evotips into the prepared Evotip boxes at S1 from A1 to A6.\\n6. Place empty Evotips, called Blanks, at S3 from A1 to A6.\\n7. Document the precise position of each placed Evotip.\\n\\n## Expected Results\\nWhen the procedure is performed correctly, you should observe:\\n- Properly seated Evotip boxes in the rack system\\n- Visible Buffer A solution in boxes (1 cm depth)\\n- All non-blank Evotips showing pale-colored SPE material discs & clear solvent meniscus above each SPE disc of each Evotip\\n- Accurate documentation of tip positions: Evotips that are placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks placed at S3 from A1 to A6.\\n\\n## Figures\\n\\n### Figure 1: Evosep positions\\n- Close-up of single Evotip box showing well positions (A1-H12)\\n\\n### Figure 2: Evotip Quality Assessment\\n- Most Evotips: Properly hydrated Evotip with pale-colored disc and visible solvent\\n- Orange-highlighted Evotip: Compromised Evotip showing white/dry disc\\n\\n## References\\n1.

       "\n",
       "### Switch timsTOF to standby\n",
       "1. In timsControl, verfy if the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standy by mode (Figure 1).\n",
       "2. Verify that the syringe is inactive in the tab 'Source' under 'Syringe Pump'. If not click on 'Stop'.\n",
       "3. In the 'source' and 'source type' sections of timsControl, choose 'CaptiveSpray' but do not activate it yet.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Remove ESI source\n",
       "4. At the instrument, disconnect the peak connector of the sample tubing (Figure 2).\n",
       "5. Disconnect the nebulizer N₂ line.\n",
       "6. Remove the ESI source housing by hinging it out like a regular door.\n",
       "7. Put on laboratory gloves.\n",
       "8. Remove the spray shield\n",
       "   ! CAUTION: The spray shield is hot.\n",
       "9. Remove the capillary cap.\n",
       "   ! CAUTION: The capillary cap is hot.\n",
       "10. Inspect the capillary position. If it appears to be partially pulled out, gently push it back into proper position without blocking the gas flow.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Mount UltraSource\n",
       "11. Hinge the UltraSource door in and close it (Figure 3).\n",
       "12. Slide the UltraSource housing onto the source door and secure it by flipping the handles located at the top right and bottom left by 180°.\n",
       "13. Connect the filter tubing to the source.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Connect column and sample line\n",
       "14. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.\n",
       "15. Verify if the LC sample line has a black NanoViper adapter attached. If not, locate an adapter and securely attach it to the sample line.\n",
       "16. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\n",
       "17. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\n",
       "18. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 3).\n",
       "   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n",
       "19. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\n",
       "20. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\n",
       "21. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\n",
       "22. Close the lid of the oven.\n",
       "23. Connect the oven to the electrical power supply.\n",
       "24. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blincking light indicates that the oven is heating up.\n",
       "    CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\n",
       "25. In timsCOntrol, activate the CaptiveSpray function in timsControl (Figure 1)\n",
       "26. Transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\n",
       "27. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
       "28. Return to timsControl and check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\n",
       "29. Monitor the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. The funnel pressur is acceptable within a 9-11 mbar range. Aim for a 10 mbar funnel pressure. Adjust the 'funnel pressure' wheel if necessary by turning counter clock-wise to reduce the pressure.\n",

       "*Estimated timing: less than 10 minute*\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch timsTOF to standby\n",
       "1. In timsControl, verfy if the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standy by mode (Figure 1).\n",
       "2. Verify that the syringe is inactive in the tab 'Source' under 'Syringe Pump'. If not click on 'Stop'.\n",
       "3. In the 'source' and 'source type' sections of timsControl, choose 'CaptiveSpray' but do not activate it yet.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Remove ESI source\n",
       "4. At the instrument, disconnect the peak connector of the sample tubing (Figure 2).\n",
       "5. Disconnect the nebulizer N₂ line.\n",
       "6. Remove the ESI source housing by hinging it out like a regular door.\n",
       "7. Put on laboratory gloves.\n",
       "8. Remove the spray shield\n",

       "9. Remove the capillary cap.\n",
       "   ! CAUTION: The capillary cap is hot.\n",
       "10. Inspect the capillary position. If it appears to be partially pulled out, gently push it back into proper position without blocking the gas flow.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Mount UltraSource\n",
       "11. Hinge the UltraSource door in and close it (Figure 3).\n",
       "12. Slide the UltraSource housing onto the source door and secure it by flipping the handles located at the top right and bottom left by 180°.\n",
       "13. Connect the filter tubing to the source.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Connect column and sample line\n",
       "14. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.\n",
       "15. Verify if the LC sample line has a black NanoViper adapter attached. If not, locate an adapter and securely attach it to the sample line.\n",
       "16. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\n",
       "17. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\n",
       "18. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 3).\n",
       "   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n",
       "19. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\n",
       "20. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\n",
       "21. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\n",
       "22. Close the lid of the oven.\n",
       "23. Connect the oven to the electrical power supply.\n",
       "24. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blincking light indicates that the oven is heating up.\n",
       "    CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\n",
       "25. In timsCOntrol, activate the CaptiveSpray function in timsControl (Figure 1)\n",
       "26. Transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\n",
       "27. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
       "28. Return to timsControl and check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\n",
       "29. Monitor the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. The funnel pressur is acceptable within a 9-11 mbar range. Aim for a 10 mbar funnel pressure. Adjust the 'funnel pressure' wheel if necessary by turning counter clock-wise to reduce the pressure.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Expected Results\n",

       "| Criterion | Rating | Explanation |\n",
       "|-----------|--------|-------------|\n",
       "| Structure | Excellent | The AI-generated lab notes (Step 4: Resulting Lab Notes) correctly retained only the essential sections: Aim, Materials, Procedure, and Results, mirroring the benchmark structure. It successfully omitted extraneous sections like Abstract, Figures, and References found in its Step 1 input processing. |\n",
       "| Tense | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense throughout the Procedure and Results sections (e.g., \"was switched\", \"was disconnected\", \"was observed\", \"appeared\") to accurately describe the actions that were performed, aligning perfectly with the benchmark's use of past tense. |\n",
       "| Language | Excellent | The AI effectively replaced instructional language (present in its Step 1 input) with observational statements describing what actually occurred (e.g., \"The TimsControl software... was switched\" instead of \"Verify that the software is in standby\"). It also incorporated observed deviations and errors using factual, observational language. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI successfully maintained the step numbering from the original protocol (presented in its Step 1 input) even when the observed order of execution deviated. It clearly marked these deviations (e.g., \"⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order:**\") and added an observed step (19.1), demonstrating adherence to the original numbering while accurately reflecting the actual process. |\n",
       "| Timing | Excellent | The AI included specific, actual timing derived from the video observations. It provided timestamps for individual actions within the procedure steps (e.g., \"(00:00:09 - 00:00:11)\") and calculated a total procedure time (\"3 minutes 50 seconds\"), replacing the benchmark's estimated time (\"less than 10 minute\") with precise, observed data. |"

       "*Estimated timing: less than 10 minute*\n",
       "\n",
       "### Switch TimsControl to 'Standby' mode\n",
       "1.  Verify that the IonOpticks column from an Evosep System is disconnected. If not disconnect them.\n",
       "    Critical step: This could be an opportune moment to perform the weekly LC system maintenance.\n",
       "2.  In timsControl, verfy that the software is in standby mode\n",
       "3.  Navigate to the 'Source', then proceed to 'SourceType' and select 'ESI'. However, do not activate the source at this moment (Figure 1).\n",

       "7.  Slide off the UltraSource housing from both the source door and the glass capillary.\n",
       "8.  Set the UltraSource housing on the bench.\n",
       "    Critical step: Never attempt to open the source door while the UltraSource is connected with the glass capillary (Figure 2 H). Such an action will cause breakage of the glass capillary.\n",
       "9.  Remove the source door by opening it and unhinging it, similar to the motion of a normal door.\n",

       "12. Attach the capillary cap securely to the glass capillary (G in Figure 3)\n",
       "    Critical step: Try not to block the vacuum flow to avoid contamination of the timsTOF for instance by blocking the whole of the capillary cap.\n",
       "13. Attach the spray shield (E) to the desolvation stage housing.\n",
       "14. Hinging the ESI source housing (F) into position as it would be a door and close it.\n",
       "15. Connect the sample inlet (B) of the ESI source and the peak tubing lines, which originate from the syringe, by turning it clock-wise.\n",

       "19. Ensure it is devoid of air bubbles.\n",
       "20. Connect the syringe to the peak tubing of the sample line.\n",
       "21. Mount this syringe within the external syringe pump setup. The golden button allows to move the syringe holder to arrange the syringe as in Figure 3.\n",

       "24. Transition the instrument into 'operate' mode by clicking on the on/off symbol.\n",
       "25. Begin flow at the syringe, ensuring that the following settings are in place in the tab 'Source' (Figure 1): Syringe: Hamilton 500 µL; Flow Rate: 3 µL/min. Press start. Keep the button next to start/stop pressed until a signal is observed in the 'Chromatogram View' and 'TIMS View' windows, which usually happens within 30 seconds.\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",

       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4.  Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5.  Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6.  In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7.  **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8.  Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9.  Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",

       "| Tense     | Excellent | The AI consistently used the past tense (e.g., \"was already loaded,\" \"was adjusted,\" \"was switched,\" \"reached,\" \"was pressed\") to describe the actions observed in the video, matching the benchmark's use of past tense for reporting completed actions.                                            |\n",

It also noted deviations. |\n",
       "| Numbering | Excellent | The AI maintained the step numbering (1-14) corresponding to the protocol it analyzed.

       "*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",
       "11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\n",
       "12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",

       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4.  Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5.  Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6.  In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7.  **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8.  Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9.  Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",

       "\n",
       "Critical step: If the instrument has been operated with another source than the UltraSource or CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\n",
       "1.  Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2.  To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\n",
       "3.  Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "4.  Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\n",
       "5.  Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\n",
       "6.  In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\n",
       "7.  **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\n",
       "8.  Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\n",
       "9.  Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\n",
       "10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\n",

       "2.  The padlock icon next to the 1/K₀ End value was activated (locked) [00:00:07].\n",
       "3.  The 1/K₀ Start value was adjusted from 0.70 to 0.85, resulting in the 1/K₀ End value automatically changing to 1.45 [00:00:10-00:00:11].\n",
       "4.  ❌ **Error:** An insufficient waiting period of approximately 16 seconds occurred [00:00:11-00:00:27] before proceeding, significantly less than the potentially required 15 minutes for TIC stabilization.\n",
       "9.  ⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order** & ❌ **Error:** The 'Calibrate' button was selected [00:00:27] *before* adjusting Scan Mode and MS Averaging. This first calibration was performed incorrectly with Scan Mode set to 'dia-PASEF' and MS Averaging set to 1.\n",
       "5.  ⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order** & ❌ **Omitted:** After the erroneous first calibration, the scan mode was switched to 'MS' [00:00:34], and MS averaging was set to 30 [00:00:36]. The polygon heatmap was not deactivated.\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",

       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.

       "2.  The researcher verbally confirmed that the TIMS device had already been calibrated in TimsControl prior to starting the queue setup.\n",
       "3.  The HyStar software was observed with the 'Acquisition' tab active.\n",
       "4.  An existing sample table (\"2024\\_maintenance\\_run\\_only\") was loaded.\n",
       "5.  Existing entries (rows 41-48) from the loaded table were copied and pasted to create new entries (rows 49-56).\n",
       "6.  The 'Sample ID' column for the new rows (49-56) was adjusted.\n",
       "7.  A sequence of 8 runs was prepared. ❌ **Error:** The critical step recommendation to start with a sacrificial blank tip appeared to be skipped, as the first sample queued (row 49) used vial S1-A1, presumably containing a sample based on Step 1's context.\n",
       "8.  The column autocompletion settings were verified by accessing the 'Configure' menu for the 'Vial' column. Settings confirmed: Tray type 'Evosep', Slots 1-6 '96evotip', autocompletion direction horizontal (rightwards).\n",
       "9.  ❌ **Error:** The Evotip positions ('Vial' column) were matched incorrectly to the stated physical placement. Although the researcher intended to set S1 A1-A6 and S3 A1-A6, the final values entered via a combination of manual selection and auto-fill were S1 A1-A3 (rows 49-51) and S3 A1-A5 (rows 52-56). Initial copy-paste errors [00:00:47, 00:00:51] were made before partial correction with auto-fill [00:01:10, 00:01:16].\n",
       "10. The 'Data Path' folder was specified for the new rows using the auto-fill function.\n",
       "11. The existing 'Separation Method' was applied to the new rows using the auto-fill function.\n",
       "12. The 'Injection Method' remained set to 'standard' (as copied from the template rows).\n",
       "13. The 'MS Method' column was populated from the copied rows; specific methods were implied by the adjusted Sample IDs.\n",
       "14. ❌ **Omitted:** The step to explicitly stop the idle flow on the Evosep ('Cancel maintenance procedure') was omitted.\n",
       "15. The sample table was saved.\n",
       "16. 'Upload Sample Conditions' was selected for the new rows (49-56). The status successfully changed to \"sample data loaded\".\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID\\_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",

       "*Estimated timing: 6 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\n",
       "    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\n",
       "2.  Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\n",
       "3.  In Hystar, navigate to the 'Acquisition' tab.\n",
       "4.  Either select 'New', and subsequently choose 'LC-MS sample table' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\n",
       "5.  In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\n",
       "6.  Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\n",
       "7.  For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\n",
       "    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\n",
       "8.  Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column 'vial' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select 'Configure'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to 'Evosep' and slots 1-6 are designated as '96Evotip'. Press 'OK'.\n",
       "9.  Match the Evotip position with the sample's location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the 'vial' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel's auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\n",
       "10. Specify a 'path' folder for storing the raw files.\n",
       "11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select 'new method' followed by 'edit method'. Choose the method type listed under 'name' and then press 'OK'. Specify its name and save it.\n",
       "12. Set the injection method to 'standard'.\n",
       "13. At 'MS method', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\n",
       "14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting 'Cancel maintenance procedure'.\n",
       "15. Save the sample table.\n",
       "16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select 'upload sample conditions' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\n",
       "17. Press 'start' and 'start sequence'.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Expected Results\n",
