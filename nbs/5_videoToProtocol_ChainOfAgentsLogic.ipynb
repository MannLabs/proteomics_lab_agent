       "This protocol describes the procedure for connecting an IonOpticks column to a timsTOF SCP instrument using an Evosep One LC system. It includes steps for ensuring proper grounding and setting the column oven temperature.\n",

       "- IonOpticks column\n",
       "- Evosep One LC system\n",

       "## Procedure\n",
       "\n",
       "*Estimated timing: 10 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Ensure that the timsTOF SCP instrument is in **standby mode**. If the instrument is in **operate mode**, switch it to **standby mode** in the **timsControl** software.\n",
       "2. **Open the lid of the column oven**.\n",
       "3. **Attach a NanoViper adapter** to the sample line connector.\n",
       "4. **Check for liquid** on top of the connector and **snip it away** if necessary.\n",
       "5. **Hold the column fitting with pliers** and **hand-tighten the sample line connector** into the column fitting. **Do not overtighten**.\n",
       "6. **Remove the NanoViper adapter**.\n",
       "7. **Ensure that the column oven is positioned as close as possible to the source**.\n",
       "8. **Tighten the screw on top of the connection** to ground the column. For longer columns, use one of the two other screws on the column oven for grounding.\n",
       "9. **Close the column oven lid**.\n",
       "10. **Set the column oven temperature to 50°C**. The column oven will blink until the temperature is reached.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Expected Results\n",
       "\n",
       "After completing these steps, the IonOpticks column should be properly connected to the timsTOF SCP instrument. The column oven should be at the correct temperature.\n",
