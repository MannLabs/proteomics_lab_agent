It includes steps for disconnecting the column, connecting the new column, and ensuring proper grounding and temperature control.\\n## Materials\\n### Equipment\\n- timsTOF SCP instrument\\n- IonOpticks column\\n- Evosep One LC system\\n- Column oven (Column Toaster)\\n- Sample line\\n- NanoViper adapter\\n- Pliers\\n### Reagents\\n- Acetonitrile (HPLC LC-MS grade)\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: 10 minutes*\\n1. **Switch the timsTOF SCP to standby mode.** In the timsControl software, click on the \"on/off Instrument\" button to change the software status from \"Operating\" to \"Standby\".\\n2. **Disconnect the old column.**\\n    a. Open the lid of the column oven (Column Toaster).\\n    b. Loosen the securing screw that grounds the ion optics column.\\n    c. Attach a NanoViper adapter to the sample line by gently pushing it onto the NanoViper connector.\\n    d. Hold the column fitting with pliers and unscrew the nano connector from the column fitting counter-clockwise.\\n    e. Place the sample line on top of the bumper of the Evosep One LC system.\\n3. **Connect the new IonOpticks column.**\\n    a. Attach a NanoViper adapter to the sample line.\\n    b. Screw the nano connector from the sample line into the column fitting clockwise.\\n    c. Remove the NanoViper adapter.\\n    d. Ensure that the column oven is as close as possible to the source.\\n    e. Ensure that the column is grounded. For shorter columns, use the screw on the source housing. For longer columns, use the screw on the column oven.\\n    f. Close the lid of the column oven.\\n    g. Ensure that the column oven is set to 50 degrees.\\n4. **Switch the timsTOF SCP to operate mode.** In the timsControl software, click on the \"on/off Instrument\" button to change the software status from \"Standby\" to \"Operating\".\\n5. **Check if the idle flow is on.** In the HyStar software, check if the idle flow is active. If not, right-click on the Evosep logo, select \"idle flow\", and then click \"Run\".\\n## Expected Results\\nAfter following this protocol, the IonOpticks column should be properly connected to the timsTOF SCP instrument and ready for use. The instrument should be in operate mode, the idle flow should be active, and the column oven should be at the correct temperature.\\n## Figures\\n- Extended Data Fig. 1: TimsControl settings\\n- Extended Data Fig. 2: Navigating in HyStar\\n- Supplementary Method Figure 1: UltraSource\\n- Supplementary Method Figure 4: Connection of a sample line of a LC system with a separation column and emitter.\\n## References\\n- Meier, F. et al.

       "## Abstract\n",
       "This protocol describes how to connect an IonOpticks column to a timsTOF SCP instrument using an Evosep One LC system. It includes steps for disconnecting the column, connecting the new column, and ensuring proper grounding and temperature control.\n",
       "## Materials\n",
       "### Equipment\n",
       "- timsTOF SCP instrument\n",
       "- IonOpticks column\n",
       "- Evosep One LC system\n",
       "- Column oven (Column Toaster)\n",
       "- Sample line\n",
       "- NanoViper adapter\n",
       "- Pliers\n",
       "### Reagents\n",
       "- Acetonitrile (HPLC LC-MS grade)\n",
       "## Procedure\n",
       "*Estimated timing: 10 minutes*\n",
       "1. **Switch the timsTOF SCP to standby mode.** In the timsControl software, click on the \"on/off Instrument\" button to change the software status from \"Operating\" to \"Standby\".\n",
       "2. **Disconnect the old column.**\n",
       "    a. Open the lid of the column oven (Column Toaster).\n",
       "    c. Attach a NanoViper adapter to the sample line by gently pushing it onto the NanoViper connector.\n",
       "    d. Hold the column fitting with pliers and unscrew the nano connector from the column fitting counter-clockwise.\n",
       "3. **Connect the new IonOpticks column.**\n",
       "    a. Attach a NanoViper adapter to the sample line.\n",
       "    b. Screw the nano connector from the sample line into the column fitting clockwise.\n",
       "    c. Remove the NanoViper adapter.\n",
       "    d. Ensure that the column oven is as close as possible to the source.\n",
       "    e. Ensure that the column is grounded. For shorter columns, use the screw on the source housing. For longer columns, use the screw on the column oven.\n",
       "    f. Close the lid of the column oven.\n",
       "    g. Ensure that the column oven is set to 50 degrees.\n",
       "4. **Switch the timsTOF SCP to operate mode.** In the timsControl software, click on the \"on/off Instrument\" button to change the software status from \"Standby\" to \"Operating\".\n",
       "5. **Check if the idle flow is on.** In the HyStar software, check if the idle flow is active. If not, right-click on the Evosep logo, select \"idle flow\", and then click \"Run\".\n",
       "## Expected Results\n",
       "After following this protocol, the IonOpticks column should be properly connected to the timsTOF SCP instrument and ready for use. The instrument should be in operate mode, the idle flow should be active, and the column oven should be at the correct temperature.\n",

       "**CONCLUSION:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The provided video does not show all the steps described in the protocol. Specifically, the steps related to loading Evotips on the Evosep One are completely missing. Additionally, some steps in the column connection protocol, such as loosening the securing screw for grounding and placing the sample line on the bumper, are not explicitly shown.\n",
       "\n",
       "The corrected protocol removes the missing steps and clarifies the remaining steps to ensure that they are directly observable in the video. This ensures that the protocol is accurate and reproducible, meeting the high standards of scientific rigor expected in the field of proteomics and mass spectrometry.\n"
