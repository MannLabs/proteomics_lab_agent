    "\n",
    "    ## Abstract\n",
    "    This protocol explains how to connect an IonOpticks column inserted into a timsTOF Ultra with an sample line of an Evosep.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Equipment\n",
    "    - IonOpticks Column\n",
    "    - timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer\n",
    "      - Equipped with UltraSource ion source\n",
    "      - Equipped with column oven for temperature control\n",
    "    - Evosep One LC System\n",
    "      - with sample line\n",
    "    - NanoViper Adapter (black)\n",
    "    - Pliers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Procedure\n",
    "    *Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Verfy that the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standing by mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Connect column and sample line\n",
    "    2. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.\n",
    "    3. Attach a black NanoViper adapter to the LC sample line.\n",
    "    4. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\n",
    "    5. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\n",
    "    6. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 1).\n",
    "      CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n",
    "    7. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\n",
    "    8. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\n",
    "    9. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\n",
    "    10. Close the lid of the oven.\n",
    "    11. Verify the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\n",
    "    12. In timsControl, transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\n",
    "    13. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
    "    14. Return to timsControl. Check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Expected Results\n",
    "    - In timsControl, signal intensity should be above 10^7\n",
    "    - Stable signal in in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)\n",

In timsControl, verfy if the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standy by mode  (Figure 1).\\n2. Verify that the syringe is inactive in the tab 'Source' under 'Syringe Pump'. If not click on 'Stop'.\\n3. In the 'source' and 'source type' sections of timsControl, choose 'CaptiveSpray' but do not activate it yet.\\n\\n### Remove ESI source\\n4. At the instrument, disconnect the peak connector of the sample tubing (Figure 2).\\n5. Disconnect the nebulizer N₂ line.\\n6. Remove the ESI source\\xa0housing by hinging it out like a regular door.\\n7. Put on laboratory gloves.\\n8. Remove the spray shield\\n   ! CAUTION: The spray shield is hot.\\n9. Remove the capillary cap.\\n   ! CAUTION: The capillary cap is hot.\\n10. Inspect the capillary position. If it appears to be partially pulled out, gently push it back into proper position without blocking the gas flow.\\n\\n### Mount UltraSource\\n11. Hinge the UltraSource door in and close it (Figure 3).\\n12. Slide the UltraSource housing onto the source door and secure it by flipping the handles located at the top right and bottom left by 180°.\\n13. Connect the filter tubing to the source.\\n\\n### Connect column and sample line\\n14. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.\\n15. Verify if the LC sample line has a black NanoViper adapter attached. If not, locate an adapter and securely attach it to the sample line.\\n16. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\\n17. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\\n18. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 3).\\n   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\\n19. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\\n20. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\\n21. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\\n22. Close the lid of the oven.\\n23. Connect the oven to the electrical power supply.\\n24. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blincking light indicates that the oven is heating up.\\n    CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.\\n\\n### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\\n25. In timsCOntrol, activate the CaptiveSpray function in timsControl (Figure 1)\\n26. Transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\\n27. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\\n28. Return to timsControl and check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\\n29. Monitor the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. The funnel pressur is acceptable within a 9-11 mbar range. Aim for a 10 mbar funnel pressure. Adjust the 'funnel pressure' wheel if necessary by turning counter clock-wise to reduce the pressure.\\n\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- In timsControl, signal intensity should be above 10^7\\n- Stable signal in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)\\n\\n\\n## Figures\\n**Figure 1: TimsControl settings before changing source.**\\n\\n**Figure 2: Apollo ESI source and gas flow pressure control wheels.**\\n\\n**Figure 3: UltraSource.**\\n\\n\\n## References\\n1.

This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\\n1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\\n2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\\n3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\\n4.

This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\\n1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\\n2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\\n3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\\n4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\\n5. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\\n6. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.\\n7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\\n8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\\n9. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate' (Figure 2).\\n10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\\n11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\\n12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\\n13.

Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\\n    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\\n2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\\n3. In Hystar, navigate to the \\'Acquisition\\' tab.\\n4. Either select \\'New\\', and subsequently choose \\'LC-MS sample table\\' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\\n5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\\n6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\\n7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\\n    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\\n8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column \\'vial\\' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select \\'Configure\\'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to \\'Evosep\\' and slots 1-6 are designated as \\'96Evotip\\'.

For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\\n    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\\n8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column \\'vial\\' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select \\'Configure\\'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to \\'Evosep\\' and slots 1-6 are designated as \\'96Evotip\\'. Press \\'OK\\'.\\n9. Match the Evotip position with the sample\\'s location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the \\'vial\\' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel\\'s auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\\n10. Specify a \\'path\\' folder for storing the raw files.\\n11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select \\'new method\\' followed by \\'edit method\\'. Choose the method type listed under \\'name\\' and then press \\'OK\\'. Specify its name and save it.\\n12. Set the injection method to \\'standard\\'.\\n13. At \\'MS method\\', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\\n14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting \\'Cancel maintenance procedure\\'.\\n15. Save the sample table.\\n16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select \\'upload sample conditions\\' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly.
