    "    ## Abstract\n",
    "    This protocol explains how to connect an IonOpticks column inserted into a timsTOF Ultra with an sample line of an Evosep.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Equipment\n",
    "    - IonOpticks Column\n",
    "    - timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer\n",
    "      - Equipped with UltraSource ion source\n",
    "      - Equipped with column oven for temperature control\n",
    "    - Evosep One LC System\n",
    "      - with sample line\n",
    "    - NanoViper Adapter (black)\n",
    "    - Pliers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Procedure\n",
    "    *Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Verfy that the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standing by mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Connect column and sample line\n",
    "    2. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.\n",
    "    3. Attach a black NanoViper adapter to the LC sample line.\n",
    "    4. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\n",
    "    5. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\n",
    "    6. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 1).\n",
    "      CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n",
    "    7. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\n",
    "    8. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\n",
    "    9. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\n",
    "    10. Close the lid of the oven.\n",
    "    11. Verify the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\n",
    "    12. In timsControl, transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\n",
    "    13. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
    "    14. Return to timsControl. Check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Expected Results\n",
    "    - In timsControl, signal intensity should be above 10^7\n",
    "    - Stable signal in in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)\n",

Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\\n    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\\n2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\\n3. In Hystar, navigate to the \\'Acquisition\\' tab.\\n4. Either select \\'New\\', and subsequently choose \\'LC-MS sample table\\' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\\n5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\\n6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\\n7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\\n    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\\n8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column \\'vial\\' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select \\'Configure\\'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to \\'Evosep\\' and slots 1-6 are designated as \\'96Evotip\\'. Press \\'OK\\'.\\n9. Match the Evotip position with the sample\\'s location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the \\'vial\\' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel\\'s auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\\n10. Specify a \\'path\\' folder for storing the raw files.\\n11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select \\'new method\\' followed by \\'edit method\\'. Choose the method type listed under \\'name\\' and then press \\'OK\\'. Specify its name and save it.\\n12. Set the injection method to \\'standard\\'.\\n13. At \\'MS method\\', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\\n14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting \\'Cancel maintenance procedure\\'.\\n15. Save the sample table.\\n16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select \\'upload sample conditions\\' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\\n17. Press \\'start\\' and \\'start sequence\\'.\\n\\n\\n## Expected Results\\nTypical chromatogram shape with MS TIC (green line) increasing drastically around 4 minutes and another increase (wash-out) at 15 minutes. Higher MS2 intensities (red line) for dia-PASEF.\\n\\n\\n## Figures\\n### Figure 1: Hystar\\n[Placeholder for Screenshot of reaauired Hystar settings]\\n\\n\\n## References\\n1.
