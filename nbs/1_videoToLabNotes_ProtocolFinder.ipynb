Actions Taken (Chronological Order):**\\n\\n*   **0:19:** The technician removes tape securing a protective covering from the tip of the IonOpticks column.\\n*   **0:26:** The technician connects the LC sample line to the IonOpticks column using a NanoViper adapter.\\n*   **0:34:** The oven is drawn closer to the UltraSource, securing it with a bottom screw.\\n*   **0:39:** Removal of the UltraSource housing.\\n*   **0:42:** UltraSource housing is set on the bench.\\n*   **0:48:** Metal grounding screw placed and secured at the column-sample line connection.\\n*   **0:49:** Removal of the source door.\\n*   **1:00:** An Apollo ESI source is shown and prepped for attachment.\\n*   **1:11:** Hinging the ESI source into position.\\n*   **1:16:** Sample inlet of the ESI source connected to the peak tubing lines originating from the syringe by turning it clock-wise.\\n*   **1:36:** Nebulizer gas inlet connected to the Nâ‚‚ line.\\n*   **1:50:** Syringe filled with tuning mix liquid.\\n*   **2:16:** Syringe connected to the peak tubing of the sample line.\\n*   **2:32:** Syringe connected to the external syringe pump setup.\\n*   **2:36:** TimsCOntrol software is set up and tuned.\\n\\n**3. Ending State:**\\n\\nThe timsTOF mass spectrometer is configured with the ESI source. The sample line and Nâ‚‚ lines are connected. A syringe containing tuning mix is connected via peak tubing. The instrument is presumably ready for operation.\\n\\n**4. Protocol Matching:**\\n\\nBased on the observed actions, this procedure most closely resembles the steps outlined in \"Change source: UltraSource to ESI source\". The actions involve the removal of the UltraSource, installation of the Apollo ESI source, and connecting lines for sample introduction and nebulization.\\n\\nProtocol number: 7'}\n",

A chromatogram window shows some traces, but no active acquisition is occurring.\\n\\n2.  **Actions Taken (Sequential):**\\n    *   The user selects a row labelled \"20250123_PAtk_hardware_tests\" from the \"Samples\" list on the left side of the HyStar window.\\n    *   The user clicks the \"Load Sample Table\" button (represented by an arrow pointing right). This populates the sample table with the contents of the selected row.\\n    *   The user selects a number of rows in the table, from H1-A1 to H1-A12, by highlighting them.\\n    *   A dialog box appears allowing the user to select the position of the samples (S1 to S6), and a range of positions (A1 to A12, etc)\\n    *   The user selects a number of rows in the table, from S3-A1 to S3-A12, by highlighting them.\\n    *   A dialog box appears allowing the user to select the position of the samples (S1 to S6), and a range of positions (A1 to A12, etc)\\n    *   The user selects a number of rows in the table, from S4-A1 to S4-A12, by highlighting them.\\n    *   A dialog box appears allowing the user to select the position of the samples (S1 to S6), and a range of positions (A1 to A12, etc)\\n    *   The user presses \"Save All\"\\n    *   The user highlights samples S1-A1 to S1-A12 and some blank samples.\\n    *   The user right-clicks and chooses \"Upload Sample Conditions\". The status column of the sample table updates to \\'loading\\'\\n    *   The user presses \"Start\" and then \"Start Sequence\". The status column of the sample table shows \"Acquisition\", and a real-time chromatogram begins to be generated.\\n\\n3.  **Ending State:** The HyStar software is actively acquiring data. The status column indicates that acquisition is in progress, and the real-time chromatogram is displaying the signal.\\n\\n4.  **Protocol Matching:** Based on the above analysis, this procedure best aligns with **Protocol number: 1**, which outlines the steps for \"Queue and measure samples in HyStar\". The video demonstrates the process of loading a sample table, adjusting sample positions, uploading sample conditions, and initiating the LC-MS acquisition sequence.\\n\\nProtocol number: 1'}\n",

The box is closed again (0:06-0:10).\\n3.  The Evotip box is placed into one of the designated slots on the Evosep One (0:10-0:15).\\n4.  The gloved hand presents a second Evotip box and places it into another designated slot on the Evosep One (0:15-0:18).\\n5.  The presenter shows a tray containing individual Evotips (0:21-0:26).\\n6.  The presenter removes individual Evotips from the tray and places them into the Evotip boxes. (0:26-0:47)\\n7.  The presenter states that they want to place samples from A1 to A6 of the boxes. (0:22-0:47)\\n8.  The tray with Evotips is placed aside (0:47-0:55).\\n\\n**3.
