The operator clicks the power icon, causing a \"Change Source\" dialog to appear. This dialog is initially cancelled. The instrument status then transitions to \"Standby\" (red/orange status panel).\\n*   At the **UltraSource**, the operator disconnects the electrical power supply cable for the column oven.\\n*   The white corrugated air filter tube is detached from the **UltraSource**.\\n*   Two retaining handles on the **UltraSource housing** (characterized by its glossy black, oblate spheroid shape) are rotated. The housing is then slid off the timsTOF instrument, exposing the internal source door and glass capillary.\\n*   The detached **UltraSource housing** is placed on a laboratory bench.\\n*   The internal **source door** (previously part of the UltraSource assembly) is opened, unhinged from the timsTOF, and also placed on the bench.\\n*   The operator dons black laboratory gloves.\\n*   A metal **capillary cap** is retrieved and carefully placed onto the exposed glass capillary of the timsTOF.\\n*   A metal **spray shield** is attached to the desolvation stage housing of the timsTOF.\\n*   An **ESI source housing** (characterized by its half-sphere shape and white warning triangles) is taken. It is hinged onto the timsTOF mass spectrometer and secured using its lever mechanism.\\n*   A red PEEK (polyetheretherketone) sample inlet tubing is connected to the newly installed **ESI source** by screwing in a fitting.\\n*   A clear nebulizer gas inlet line is connected to the **ESI source**.\\n*   The operator takes a **syringe**, proceeds to a solvent cabinet, opens a bottle (presumably containing Tuning Mix), expels any residual liquid from the syringe, and then carefully withdraws new Tuning Mix solution, ensuring no air bubbles are entrained.\\n*   Returning to the timsTOF, the operator connects the Tuning Mix-filled **syringe** to the red PEEK sample inlet tubing already attached to the ESI source.\\n*   The **syringe** is then mounted into an external syringe pump assembly situated on top of the timsTOF.\\n*   The operator returns to the **TimsControl** software. In the \"Change Source\" dialog (or a newly opened one), \"ESI\" is selected as the source type, and the \"Activate Source\" button is clicked.\\n*   The **TimsControl** software status changes from \"Standby\" back to \"Operating\" (green status panel).\\n*   Within the \"Source\" tab of **TimsControl**, under the \"Syringe Pump\" section, the operator confirms syringe parameters (e.g., Hamilton 500 µL) and sets a flow rate (3 µL/min). The \"Start\" button is pressed to initiate infusion of the Tuning Mix.\\n*   The operator observes the signal trace in **TimsControl** and audibly notes an anomaly (\"Hmm, something is strange\").\\n\\n**3. Identify the ending state:**\\nThe timsTOF mass spectrometer is now configured with the **ESI source**. The previously installed **UltraSource housing** and its associated source door have been removed and are resting on the lab bench. A **syringe** containing Tuning Mix is connected to the ESI source\\'s sample inlet and is actively infusing solution via the external syringe pump. The nebulizer gas line is also connected to the ESI source. The **TimsControl** software is in \"Operating\" mode, and the system is actively acquiring data, though an unexpected signal characteristic has been observed by the operator.\\n\\n**4. Match to a protocol number:**\\nThe observed sequence of disassembling the UltraSource and installing the ESI source, including the software steps for changing the source type and initiating infusion with a syringe pump, aligns precisely with the procedure for changing from an UltraSource to an ESI source.\\n\\nProtocol number: 7'}\n",
