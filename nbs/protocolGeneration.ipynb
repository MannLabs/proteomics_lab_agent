    "        \"ai_protocol\": \"# Connecting an IonOpticks Aurora Series Column to a Bruker timsTOF for LC-MS/MS Analysis\\n\\n## Abstract\\nThis protocol provides a step-by-step guide for the correct physical and electrical connection of an IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column to the CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source of a Bruker timsTOF series mass spectrometer. The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n### Equipment\\n| Equipment | Description | Source/Cat. No. |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Mass Spectrometer | Bruker timsTOF SCP, Pro, or similar model equipped with a CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source. | Bruker Daltonik |\\n| LC System | An LC system capable of nano-flow rates, such as the Evosep One. | Evosep |\\n| UHPLC Column | IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column with integrated emitter. | IonOpticks |\\n| Pliers | Needle-nose or similar pliers for securely holding the column fitting. | Standard lab supplier |\\n| Gloves | Nitrile or latex laboratory gloves. | Standard lab supplier |\\n| Nano-connector adapter | (Optional) A tool to aid in finger-tightening nano-fittings. | - |\\n\\n### Software\\n| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Bruker timsControl | Not specified in video | Instrument control and data monitoring for timsTOF systems. | Provided with Bruker timsTOF systems |\\n| Bruker HyStar | Not specified in video | Manages the LC system and autosampler, and coordinates with timsControl. | Provided with Bruker LC-MS systems |\\n\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: 5-10 minutes (including heating time)*\\n\\n### System Preparation and State Verification\\n\\n1.  In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.\\n2.  **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.\\n\\n### Physical Connection of the Column\\n\\n3.  Wear clean laboratory gloves.\\n4.  Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.\\n5.  Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.\\n6.  Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.\\n7.  Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\\n\\n    > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\\n\\n### Positioning, Grounding, and Heating\\n\\n8.  Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.\\n9.  Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.\\n10. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.\\n11. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.\\n\\n### Establishing Electrospray and Signal\\n\\n12. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.\\n13. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.\\n14. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.\\n15. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.\\n- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\\n- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray. The system is now ready for data acquisition.\\n\\n## Figures\\n\\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\\n![Placeholder for an image showing the three key steps of the physical connection: (A) Holding the column fitting steady with pliers.

Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\\n19. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\\n20. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\\n21. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\\n22. Close the lid of the oven.\\n23. Connect the oven to the electrical power supply.\\n24. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blincking light indicates that the oven is heating up.\\n    CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.\\n\\n### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\\n25. In timsCOntrol, activate the CaptiveSpray function in timsControl (Figure 1)\\n26. Transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\\n27. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\\n28. Return to timsControl and check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\\n29. Monitor the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. The funnel pressur is acceptable within a 9-11 mbar range. Aim for a 10 mbar funnel pressure. Adjust the 'funnel pressure' wheel if necessary by turning counter clock-wise to reduce the pressure.\\n\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- In timsControl, signal intensity should be above 10^7\\n- Stable signal in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)\\n\\n\\n## Figures\\n**Figure 1: TimsControl settings before changing source.**\\n\\n**Figure 2: Apollo ESI source and gas flow pressure control wheels.**\\n\\n**Figure 3: UltraSource.**\\n\\n\\n## References\\n1.

Verify the Evotips were placed on top of the Evosep LC system. In this example, 5 ng HeLa Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6.\\n    Note: Blank Evotis can be unused and dry Evotips.\\n2. Verify that the TIMS device in TimsControl is calibrated. The TIMS device should be calibrated each time before you start a sample queue.\\n3. In Hystar, navigate to the \\'Acquisition\\' tab.\\n4. Either select \\'New\\', and subsequently choose \\'LC-MS sample table\\' (Figure 1) to generate a new sample table or choose an already existing sample table by pressing the arrow down button when hovering over the sample table name in the left sample table column.\\n5. In both cases, copy already existing sample table entries to modify them.\\n6. Adjust the sample ID so that it follows this pattern: currentDate_massSpec_user_sampleType_projectID_ sampleName. Typical examples for sampleType: \"SA_blank\", \"MA_HeLa\", \"DIAMA_HeLa\".\\n7. For performance evaluation of the LC-MS system, we recommend to queue one blank, three dda-PASEF runs, three dia-PASEF runs and ending with another blank.\\n    Critical step: Always start the queue with a sacrificial Evotip such as a blank tip as the first run might have altered chromatographic conditions that could introduce technical errors to your measurements.\\n8. Verify the column autocompletion settings with right-click on a field in the column \\'vial\\' such as S1-A1 in Figure 1 and select \\'Configure\\'. The arrows allow one to define the direction in which the vial positions on the 96-well are autocompleted when dragging values similar to Excel in the sample table. Decide whether the values should increase from A1-A12 indicated by arrows pointing to right. Ensure that the tray type is set to \\'Evosep\\' and slots 1-6 are designated as \\'96Evotip\\'. Press \\'OK\\'.\\n9. Match the Evotip position with the sample\\'s location in the Evotip box: From S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks at S3 from A1 to A6. To do this, press the arrow next to the value in the \\'vial\\' column (Figure 1). Select the position where the first Evotip is placed, for instance S1 A1. You can then either specify all remaining positions automatically by dragging the values (similar to Excel\\'s auto-fill function) or specify each position individually.\\n10. Specify a \\'path\\' folder for storing the raw files.\\n11. Choose an existing separation method or create a new one. To create a new separation method, right-click on the separation method field, select \\'new method\\' followed by \\'edit method\\'. Choose the method type listed under \\'name\\' and then press \\'OK\\'. Specify its name and save it.\\n12. Set the injection method to \\'standard\\'.\\n13. At \\'MS method\\', load either dda-PASEF and dia-PASEF maintenance methods to check the LC-MS performance or the method intended to be used for measuring the study.\\n14. Stop the idle flow on the Evosep by right-clicking on the Evosep logo and selecting \\'Cancel maintenance procedure\\'.\\n15. Save the sample table.\\n16. Right-click somewhere on the top row of the freshly defined sample table entries and select \\'upload sample conditions\\' to pre-check if all LC and MS method can be loaded correctly. The status should be change to loaded.\\n17. Press \\'start\\' and \\'start sequence\\'.\\n\\n\\n## Expected Results\\nTypical chromatogram shape with MS TIC (green line) increasing drastically around 4 minutes and another increase (wash-out) at 15 minutes.

This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration.\\n1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method - for instance a dda-PASEF or dia-PASEF method. The method should have an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range of the method intended to be use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively (Figure 1: 6, 7). This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\\n2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end (Figure 1: 7).\\n3. Adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for linear calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\\n4. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes.\\n5. Switch the scan mode to \\'MS\\', set MS averaging to 30 and deactivate the polygon heatmap (Figure 1: 4, 9, 14).\\n6. In timsControl, navigate to \\'calibration\\', then \\'mobility\\'.\\n7. **Not included in video** From reference lists, select the list \\'[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)\\' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221.\\n8. Specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width (Figure 2).\\n9. Proceed by selecting \\'calibrate\\' (Figure 2).\\n10. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list.\\n11. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window.\\n12. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\\n13. Select \"Method\" > \"Load Recent\", select the same method, and then click \"Discard changes\" in the pop-up window.\\n14. Set MS averaging to 1.\\n\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- The score in the tab \"Calibration\" should be at 100%\\n\\n\\n## Figures\\n### Figure 1: TimsControl settings\\n\\n### Figure 2: Ion mobility calibration\\n\\n## Tables\\nTable 1: Gas Flow Parameters for UltraSource\\n\\n| Instrument Type | Calibrant 922 Voltage [V] |\\n|----------------|---------------------------|\\n| timsTOF Pro, SCP | 160 |\\n| timsTOF HT, Ultra | 200 |\\n\\n## References\\n1.

    "        \"ai_protocol\": \"# Protocol: On-Bead Protein Digestion of Plasma Samples for Proteomic Analysis\\n\\n## Abstract\\nThis protocol details a robust method for the enrichment and subsequent proteolytic digestion of proteins directly on magnetic beads. The procedure is optimized for plasma samples and involves protein binding to functionally-specific magnetic beads, stringent washing steps to remove non-specific binders, and an efficient on-bead digestion using a Trypsin/Lys-C mixture. The resulting peptide mixture is suitable for direct analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach minimizes sample handling losses and is readily adaptable for various affinity-based proteomics workflows, such as targeted protein pulldowns or analysis of post-translationally modified sub-proteomes.\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n### Equipment\\n- **Magnetic separator:** A magnetic rack or device compatible with 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes or 96-well plates.\\n- **Centrifuge:** A microcentrifuge capable of reaching at least 2,000 x g, preferably refrigerated.\\n- **Thermomixer or Heat Block:** Capable of incubation at 37°C and 90°C with shaking.\\n- **Pipettes:** A set of calibrated single-channel pipettes (e.g., P20, P200, P1000) and corresponding tips.\\n- **Microcentrifuge tubes or 96-well plates:** Low-protein-binding 1.5 mL tubes or 96-well PCR/storage plates (e.g., Eppendorf, cat. no. 0030124332).\\n\\n### Reagents\\n- **Magnetic Beads:** The choice of magnetic beads is dependent on the experimental goal (e.g., streptavidin-coated for biotinylated targets, antibody-conjugated for immunoprecipitation). The protocol assumes a slurry format.\\n- **Human Plasma:** Collected in EDTA or citrate tubes. Can be used fresh or previously frozen at -80°C.\\n    * **Optional:** Platelet-contaminated plasma can be used if relevant to the experimental question.\\n- **Deionized, distilled water (ddH₂O):** Ultrapure, MS-grade.\\n- **Binding/Wash Buffer:** This buffer is user-defined and dependent on the chemistry of the magnetic beads and the protein interaction being studied. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the beads or a validated buffer screen (e.g., \\\"Philipp's buffer screen\\\").\\n- **Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB):** 100 mM Tris, 10 mM TCEP, 40 mM Chloroacetamide (CAA).\\n    * To prepare 40 mL:\\n        * Tris base: 526.6 mg\\n        * Chloroacetamide (CAA): 149.6 mg ! **CAUTION:** CAA is toxic and a carcinogen. Handle with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).\\n        * 0.5 M TCEP solution: 0.8 mL\\n        * Add ddH₂O to a final volume of 40 mL.\\n    * **Alternative preparation from solids:** Combine Tris and CAA as above, then add 114.7 mg of TCEP-HCl. Adjust pH to ~8.0-8.5 before adding water to the final volume. **CRITICAL** Always verify the pH after preparation.\\n- **Trypsin, MS-grade:** (e.g., Promega, cat. no. V5111). Resuspend to a stock concentration of 0.5 µg/µL in a suitable buffer (e.g., 50 mM acetic acid).\\n- **Lys-C, MS-grade:** (e.g., Promega, cat. no. V1671). Resuspend to a stock concentration of 0.5 µg/µL in a suitable buffer (e.g., ddH₂O).\\n- **Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA):** (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 28904). Prepare a 0.2% (v/v) solution in ddH₂O. ! **CAUTION:** TFA is corrosive. Handle in a fume hood with appropriate PPE.\\n\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: ~1.5 hours hands-on time, ~12-18 hours for overnight digestion.*\\n\\n### Bead Preparation and Protein Binding\\n*Timing: ~45 minutes*\\n\\n1.  In a microcentrifuge tube, aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry.\\n2.  Place the tube on a magnetic separator. Once the beads are captured and the supernatant is clear, carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant.\\n3.  Wash the beads by removing the tube from the magnet, adding 200 µL of ddH₂O, and gently resuspending the beads.\\n4.  Recapture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant. Repeat this wash step once for a total of two washes.\\n5.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the user-defined Binding/Wash Buffer.\\n6.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.\\n    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Ensure plasma is fully thawed and vortexed before addition. If starting with frozen plasma, centrifuge at high speed (e.g., 14,000 x g, 10 min, 4°C) to pellet any cryoprecipitates and use the clear supernatant.\\n7.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking in a thermomixer to facilitate protein binding.\\n\\n### Washing\\n*Timing: ~15 minutes*\\n\\n8.  Following incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube at 2,000 x g for 1 minute to pellet the beads.\\n    * **Alternative:** Use a magnetic separator to capture the beads. Centrifugation is recommended to ensure collection of all beads.\\n9.  Place the tube on the magnetic separator, allow the beads to be captured, and carefully discard the supernatant.\\n10. Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer and gently resuspending.\\n11. Capture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant.\\n12. Repeat steps 10-11 once for a total of two washes. After the final wash, remove the supernatant as completely as possible.\\n    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Complete removal of the wash buffer is essential to avoid interfering with the subsequent digestion step. Use a small-volume pipette tip to remove any residual liquid after the main aspiration.\\n\\n### On-Bead Digestion\\n*Timing: ~25 minutes hands-on, 4 hours to overnight for digestion*\\n\\n13. Resuspend the washed beads in 50 µL of Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB).\\n14. Incubate the sample for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking in a thermomixer to denature, reduce, and alkylate the bound proteins.\\n15. After incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube to collect any condensate from the lid and walls. Let the sample cool to room temperature (~5-10 minutes).\\n16. Prepare a fresh Trypsin/Lys-C enzyme master mix. For each sample, combine:\\n    * Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB): 8 µL\\n    * Trypsin stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL\\n    * Lys-C stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL\\n    * *Note: Prepare a master mix for all samples, including a 10% excess to account for pipetting inaccuracies. For example, for 10 samples, mix 88 µL LDB, 11 µL Trypsin, and 11 µL Lys-C.*\\n17. Add 10 µL of the enzyme master mix to each sample. The total volume is now ~60 µL.\\n18. Digest the proteins by incubating the samples overnight (12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking.\\n    * **PAUSE POINT:** The digestion time can be optimized. A shorter digestion of 4 hours may be sufficient for some applications.\\n\\n### Sample Acidification and Peptide Collection\\n*Timing: ~10 minutes*\\n\\n19. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample. Mix well by pipetting up and down. The final volume will be approximately 110 µL.\\n20. Place the tubes on the magnetic separator to capture the beads.\\n21. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which now contains the digested peptides, to a fresh, clean 96-well plate or microcentrifuge tube. Discard the plate/tubes containing the beads. The sample is now ready for LC-MS/MS analysis or further fractionation.\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n-   Starting with 10 µL of human plasma, this enrichment and digestion procedure is expected to yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides in the final 110 µL volume.\\n-   A standard injection volume for LC-MS/MS analysis would be 20 µL of the final peptide solution, corresponding to a load of approximately 150-160 ng of peptides on the column.\\n\\n## Figures\\n### Figure 1: Workflow for On-Bead Digestion of Plasma Proteins\\n[Placeholder for a flowchart diagram illustrating the main steps: (A) Bead Washing, (B) Protein Binding from Plasma, (C) Post-binding Washes, (D) On-bead Lysis and Digestion, and (E) Peptide Elution and Collection.]\",\n",

The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n### Equipment\\n| Equipment | Description | Source/Cat. No. |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Mass Spectrometer | Bruker timsTOF SCP, Pro, or similar model equipped with a CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source. | Bruker Daltonik |\\n| LC System | An LC system capable of nano-flow rates, such as the Evosep One. | Evosep |\\n| UHPLC Column | IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column with integrated emitter. | IonOpticks |\\n| Pliers | Needle-nose or similar pliers for securely holding the column fitting. | Standard lab supplier |\\n| Gloves | Nitrile or latex laboratory gloves. | Standard lab supplier |\\n| Nano-connector adapter | (Optional) A tool to aid in finger-tightening nano-fittings. | - |\\n\\n### Software\\n| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Bruker timsControl | Not specified in video | Instrument control and data monitoring for timsTOF systems. | Provided with Bruker timsTOF systems |\\n| Bruker HyStar | Not specified in video | Manages the LC system and autosampler, and coordinates with timsControl. | Provided with Bruker LC-MS systems |\\n\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: 5-10 minutes (including heating time)*\\n\\n### System Preparation and State Verification\\n\\n1.  In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.\\n2.  **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.\\n\\n### Physical Connection of the Column\\n\\n3.  Wear clean laboratory gloves.\\n4.  Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.\\n5.  Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.\\n6.  Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.\\n7.  Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\\n\\n    > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\\n\\n### Positioning, Grounding, and Heating\\n\\n8.  Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.\\n9.  Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.\\n10. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.\\n11. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.\\n\\n### Establishing Electrospray and Signal\\n\\n12. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.\\n13. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.\\n14. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.\\n15. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.\\n- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\\n- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray.

    "            \"# Connecting IonOpticks Column & sample line of Evosep\\n\\n## Abstract\\nThis protocol explains how to connect an IonOpticks column inserted into a timsTOF Ultra with an sample line of an Evosep.\\n\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n### Equipment\\n- IonOpticks Column\\n- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer\\n  - Equipped with UltraSource ion source\\n  - Equipped with column oven for temperature control\\n- Evosep One LC System\\n  - with sample line\\n- NanoViper Adapter (black)\\n- Pliers\\n\\n\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\\n\\n1. Verfy that the instrument is in standing by mode. If not press the on/off button to switch from operate mode to standing by mode.\\n\\n### Connect column and sample line\\n2. Verify that an IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.\\n3. Attach a black NanoViper adapter to the LC sample line.\\n4. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line for instance by snipping it off.\\n5. Hold the column fititng of the IonOpticks column with a pliers.\\n6. Hand-tighten the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting (Figure 1).\\n   CRITICAL STEP: Be careful not to overtighten the connection between the IonOpticks column and the timsTOF Ultra. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\\n7. Remove the NanoViper adapter so that the oven can be tightly closed.\\n8. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (Figure 2).\\n9. Lift and place the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\\n10. Close the lid of the oven.\\n11. Verify the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven, respectively.\\n\\n### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow\\n12. In timsControl, transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.\\n13. Navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow is active. If not right-click on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.\\n14. Return to timsControl. Check the MS signal. It should be around 2.5x10^7.\\n\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- In timsControl, signal intensity should be above 10^7\\n- Stable signal in in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)\\n\\n\\n## Figures\\n### Figure 1: Connection of a sample line of a LC system with a separation column and emitter.**\\n\\n### Figure 2: UltraSource.**\\n\\n\\n## References\\n1.
