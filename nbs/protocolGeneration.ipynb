    "    \"ai_protocol\": \"# Connecting an IonOpticks Aurora Series Column to a Bruker timsTOF for LC-MS/MS Analysis\\n\\n## Abstract\\nThis protocol provides a step-by-step guide for the correct physical and electrical connection of an IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column to the CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source of a Bruker timsTOF series mass spectrometer. The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n### Equipment\\n| Equipment | Description | Source/Cat. No. |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Mass Spectrometer | Bruker timsTOF SCP, Pro, or similar model equipped with a CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source. | Bruker Daltonik |\\n| LC System | An LC system capable of nano-flow rates, such as the Evosep One. | Evosep |\\n| UHPLC Column | IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column with integrated emitter. | IonOpticks |\\n| Pliers | Needle-nose or similar pliers for securely holding the column fitting. | Standard lab supplier |\\n| Gloves | Nitrile or latex laboratory gloves. | Standard lab supplier |\\n| Nano-connector adapter | (Optional) A tool to aid in finger-tightening nano-fittings. | - |\\n\\n### Software\\n| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Bruker timsControl | Not specified in video | Instrument control and data monitoring for timsTOF systems. | Provided with Bruker timsTOF systems |\\n| Bruker HyStar | Not specified in video | Manages the LC system and autosampler, and coordinates with timsControl. | Provided with Bruker LC-MS systems |\\n\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: 5-10 minutes (including heating time)*\\n\\n### System Preparation and State Verification\\n\\n1.  In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.\\n2.  **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.\\n\\n### Physical Connection of the Column\\n\\n3.  Wear clean laboratory gloves.\\n4.  Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.\\n5.  Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.\\n6.  Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.\\n7.  Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\\n\\n    > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\\n\\n### Positioning, Grounding, and Heating\\n\\n8.  Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.\\n9.  Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.\\n10. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.\\n11. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.\\n\\n### Establishing Electrospray and Signal\\n\\n12. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.\\n13. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.\\n14. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.\\n15. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.\\n- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\\n- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray. The system is now ready for data acquisition.\\n\\n## Figures\\n\\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\\n![Placeholder for an image showing the three key steps of the physical connection: (A) Holding the column fitting steady with pliers.

Following incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube at 2,000 x g for 1 minute to pellet the beads.\\n    * **Alternative:** Use a magnetic separator to capture the beads. Centrifugation is recommended to ensure collection of all beads.\\n9.  Place the tube on the magnetic separator, allow the beads to be captured, and carefully discard the supernatant.\\n10. Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer and gently resuspending.\\n11. Capture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant.\\n12. Repeat steps 10-11 once for a total of two washes. After the final wash, remove the supernatant as completely as possible.\\n    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Complete removal of the wash buffer is essential to avoid interfering with the subsequent digestion step. Use a small-volume pipette tip to remove any residual liquid after the main aspiration.\\n\\n### On-Bead Digestion\\n*Timing: ~25 minutes hands-on, 4 hours to overnight for digestion*\\n\\n13. Resuspend the washed beads in 50 µL of Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB).\\n14. Incubate the sample for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking in a thermomixer to denature, reduce, and alkylate the bound proteins.\\n15. After incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube to collect any condensate from the lid and walls. Let the sample cool to room temperature (~5-10 minutes).\\n16. Prepare a fresh Trypsin/Lys-C enzyme master mix. For each sample, combine:\\n    * Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB): 8 µL\\n    * Trypsin stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL\\n    * Lys-C stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL\\n    * *Note: Prepare a master mix for all samples, including a 10% excess to account for pipetting inaccuracies. For example, for 10 samples, mix 88 µL LDB, 11 µL Trypsin, and 11 µL Lys-C.*\\n17. Add 10 µL of the enzyme master mix to each sample. The total volume is now ~60 µL.\\n18. Digest the proteins by incubating the samples overnight (12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking.\\n    * **PAUSE POINT:** The digestion time can be optimized. A shorter digestion of 4 hours may be sufficient for some applications.\\n\\n### Sample Acidification and Peptide Collection\\n*Timing: ~10 minutes*\\n\\n19. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample. Mix well by pipetting up and down. The final volume will be approximately 110 µL.\\n20. Place the tubes on the magnetic separator to capture the beads.\\n21. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which now contains the digested peptides, to a fresh, clean 96-well plate or microcentrifuge tube. Discard the plate/tubes containing the beads. The sample is now ready for LC-MS/MS analysis or further fractionation.\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n-   Starting with 10 µL of human plasma, this enrichment and digestion procedure is expected to yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides in the final 110 µL volume.\\n-   A standard injection volume for LC-MS/MS analysis would be 20 µL of the final peptide solution, corresponding to a load of approximately 150-160 ng of peptides on the column.\\n\\n## Figures\\n### Figure 1: Workflow for On-Bead Digestion of Plasma Proteins\\n[Placeholder for a flowchart diagram illustrating the main steps: (A) Bead Washing, (B) Protein Binding from Plasma, (C) Post-binding Washes, (D) On-bead Lysis and Digestion, and (E) Peptide Elution and Collection.]\",\n",

The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n### Equipment\\n| Equipment | Description | Source/Cat. No. |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Mass Spectrometer | Bruker timsTOF SCP, Pro, or similar model equipped with a CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source. | Bruker Daltonik |\\n| LC System | An LC system capable of nano-flow rates, such as the Evosep One. | Evosep |\\n| UHPLC Column | IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column with integrated emitter. | IonOpticks |\\n| Pliers | Needle-nose or similar pliers for securely holding the column fitting. | Standard lab supplier |\\n| Gloves | Nitrile or latex laboratory gloves. | Standard lab supplier |\\n| Nano-connector adapter | (Optional) A tool to aid in finger-tightening nano-fittings. | - |\\n\\n### Software\\n| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Bruker timsControl | Not specified in video | Instrument control and data monitoring for timsTOF systems. | Provided with Bruker timsTOF systems |\\n| Bruker HyStar | Not specified in video | Manages the LC system and autosampler, and coordinates with timsControl. | Provided with Bruker LC-MS systems |\\n\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: 5-10 minutes (including heating time)*\\n\\n### System Preparation and State Verification\\n\\n1.  In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.\\n2.  **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.\\n\\n### Physical Connection of the Column\\n\\n3.  Wear clean laboratory gloves.\\n4.  Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.\\n5.  Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.\\n6.  Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.\\n7.  Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\\n\\n    > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\\n\\n### Positioning, Grounding, and Heating\\n\\n8.  Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.\\n9.  Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.\\n10. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.\\n11. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.\\n\\n### Establishing Electrospray and Signal\\n\\n12. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.\\n13. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.\\n14. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.\\n15. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.\\n- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\\n- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray. The system is now ready for data acquisition.\\n\\n## Figures\\n\\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\\n![Placeholder for an image showing the three key steps of the physical connection: (A) Holding the column fitting steady with pliers.
