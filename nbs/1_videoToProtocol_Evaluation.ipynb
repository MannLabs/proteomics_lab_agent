    "## Abstract\n",
    "This protocol describes the procedure for connecting an IonOpticks column to a timsTOF SCP instrument. It includes steps for ensuring proper connection of the sample line, grounding the column, and setting the column oven temperature. The protocol also covers checking the instrument status and idle flow using the timsControl and HyStar software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials\n",
    "### Equipment\n",
    "* timsTOF SCP instrument\n",
    "* IonOpticks column\n",
    "* Sample line with nano connector\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reagents\n",
    "* Solvent for the IonOpticks column (as recommended by the manufacturer)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated timing: 5 minutes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check the software. Ensure that the timsTOF SCP instrument is in standby mode in the timsControl software. If the instrument is in operate mode, switch it to standby mode.\n",
    "2. Connect the column to the sample line. a. Insert the IonOpticks column into the Ultrasource. b. Connect the nano connector adapter to the sample line. c. Connect the sample line to the column using the adapter. d. Check for leaks by visually inspecting the connection for any liquid droplets. If there are leaks, tighten the connection or replace the column or emitter.\n",
    "3. Secure the connection. Use pliers to tighten the sample line connector to the column. Ensure that the connection is finger tight but not over tightened.\n",
    "4. Remove the adapter. Carefully remove the nano connector adapter from the sample line.\n",
    "5. Position the column oven. a. Loosen the screw on the column oven to adjust its position. b. Move the oven as close as possible to the source. c. Tighten the screw to secure the oven in place.\n",
    "6. Ground the column. a. Locate the grounding screw on the column oven. b. Use the screw to ground the column to the oven. c. If the column is longer, use the additional grounding screw on the oven to ensure proper grounding.\n",
    "7. Close the column oven. Ensure that the lid is securely closed.\n",
    "8. Set the column oven temperature. a. Check the temperature indicator on the column oven. b. Adjust the temperature to 50°C for IonOpticks columns. The temperature is indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column toaster. c. Wait for the temperature to stabilize. The lights will stop blinking when the temperature is stable.\n",
    "9. Switch the instrument to operate mode. In the timsControl software, click the on/off button to switch the instrument to operate mode.\n",
    "10. Check the idle flow. In the HyStar software, check that the idle flow is on. If it is not, right-click on the Evosep logo, select 'Preparation', then select 'Idle flow' and 'Run'.\n",
    "11. Confirm signal. Verify that there is signal in the timsControl and HyStar software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Results\n",
    "After completing these steps, the IonOpticks column should be properly connected to the timsTOF SCP instrument. The instrument should be in operate mode, the idle flow should be on, and there should be signal in both the timsControl and HyStar software.\n",

    "Step 2: AI-Generated Protocol (Verbatim)\\n\\n# Connecting an IonOpticks Column to a Bruker timsTOF SCP Mass Spectrometer and Initiating LC-MS Operation\\n\\n## Abstract\\nThis protocol details the procedure for connecting an IonOpticks analytical column, via its sample line, to the UltraSource of a Bruker timsTOF SCP mass spectrometer. It includes steps for verifying system readiness in timsControl and HyStar software, making the fluidic connection, ensuring proper column heating and grounding, and initiating system operation to observe a signal. This procedure is essential for preparing the LC-MS system for data acquisition.\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n### Equipment\\n- **Bruker timsTOF SCP Mass Spectrometer:** Equipped with an UltraSource and integrated column oven.\\n- **Evosep One LC System:** (or compatible nanoLC system)\\n- **IonOpticks Column:** Pre-installed in the column oven assembly (e.g., Aurora Series).\\n- **Sample Line:** Fused silica capillary with appropriate nano-fitting (e.g., PEEK fitting) for connection to the IonOpticks column inlet.\\n- **Metal Adapter (optional, for tightening):** To aid in gripping the sample line fitting if necessary (removed after connection).\\n- **Flat-Jawed Pliers:** For counter-holding the column inlet fitting during connection (e.g., Knipex Pliers Wrench).\\n- **Computer Workstation:** Running Bruker timsControl and Bruker HyStar software.\\n- **Personal Protective Equipment:** Nitrile gloves.\\n\\n### Reagents\\n- Solvents for LC system (appropriate for column flushing and operation, e.g., mobile phases A and B).\\n\\n## Procedure\\n*Estimated timing: Approximately 3 minutes*\\n\\n### 1. Verify Mass Spectrometer Status in timsControl\\n1.  Navigate to the Bruker timsControl software.\\n2.  Check the \"Automation\" status panel. If the system is in \"Operating\" mode, click on the \"HyStar\" button (or equivalent control for your LC) to switch the mass spectrometer to \"Standby by\" mode.\\n*   **CRITICAL STEP** For IonOpticks columns, ensure the MS is not in \"Operate\" mode for extended periods without flow, and conversely, ensure it is in \"Standby\" if flow is active but no acquisition is running, to prevent damage.\\n\\n### 2. Prepare and Connect the Sample Line to the IonOpticks Column\\n1.  Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already installed in the column oven, and the oven is mounted on the UltraSource.\\n2.  Take the sample line originating from the LC system.\\n3.  If using a metal adapter for easier tightening, push it onto the PEEK fitting of the sample line.\\n4.  Inspect the open end of the sample line capillary. Ensure it is clean and patent. If necessary, carefully trim the end.\\n5.  Carefully hold the inlet fitting of the installed IonOpticks column using flat-jawed pliers to provide counter-torque.\\n6.  Insert the sample line fitting (with or without the metal adapter) into the column's inlet fitting.\\n7.  Hand-tighten the sample line fitting into the column connector until finger-tight. **CAUTION:** Do not overtighten, as this can damage the fittings or the column.\\n8.  If a metal adapter was used on the sample line fitting, remove it now.\\n\\n### 3. Verify Column Oven and Grounding\\n1.  Ensure the column oven assembly is positioned correctly, typically as close as possible to the ion source inlet. Adjust using the positioning screw if necessary.\\n2.  Verify that a grounding screw is making contact with the column assembly or its connector to ensure proper grounding. Multiple grounding points may be available; ensure at least one is correctly engaged.\\n3.  Close the column oven lid. A click should be audible.\\n4.  Observe the LED indicator lights on the column oven. Three blinking green lights indicate the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid once the temperature is reached.\\n\\n### 4. Initiate System Operation and Verify Signal\\n1.  Return to the Bruker timsControl software.\\n2.  Click on the \"HyStar\" button (or equivalent LC control) in the \"Automation\" panel to switch the mass spectrometer to \"Operating\" mode.\\n3.  Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software (or your LC control software).\\n4.  Verify that \"Idle Flow\" is active. If not, initiate idle flow (e.g., by right-clicking and selecting an \"Idle Flow run\" or similar command).\\n5.  Once the LC system indicates flow and the MS is in operate mode, observe the timsControl software for a stable spray and detection of ions (e.g., background ions from the mobile phase).\\n\\n## Expected Results\\n- The sample line is securely connected to the IonOpticks column without leaks.\\n- The column oven is closed and heating to the set temperature (e.g., 50 °C), indicated by the LEDs.\\n- The column is properly grounded.\\n- The timsTOF SCP mass spectrometer is in \"Operating\" mode.\\n- The LC system is delivering flow (idle flow).\\n- A stable ion signal is observable in the timsControl software, indicating the system is ready for sample analysis.\\n\\n## Figures\\n### Figure 1: Software Status Check in timsControl.\\n[Placeholder for a screenshot showing the timsControl interface with the \"Automation\" panel, highlighting the switch from \"Operating\" to \"Standby by\" (0:16-0:24).]\\n\\n### Figure 2: Connecting the Sample Line to the IonOpticks Column.\\n[Placeholder for an image depicting the hand-tightening of the sample line fitting into the column inlet fitting, with pliers used for counter-holding (1:06-1:16).]\\n\\n### Figure 3: Column Oven and Grounding Verification.\\n[Placeholder for an image showing the closed column oven with blinking/solid green LED temperature indicators and a finger pointing to a grounding screw (2:00-2:10).]\\n\\n### Figure 4: System Operating with Signal in timsControl.\\n[Placeholder for a screenshot of the timsControl interface in \"Operating\" mode, displaying chromatogram and mass spectrum views indicating a live signal (2:38-2:41).]\\n\\n## References\\n1.
