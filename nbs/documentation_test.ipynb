       "\n",
       "# Procedure\n",
       "\n",
       "*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n",
       "\n",
       "**Critical Step:** If the instrument has been operated with another source than the CaptiveSpray source, it is highly recommended to wait for 3 hours before initiating the TIMS calibration process. This waiting period permits the temperature and pressure to stabilise, thus ensuring a steady TIMS calibration. \n",
       "\n",
       "1. Use timsControl to load a performance evaluation method, a dda-PASEF method. Choose an ion mobility range that matches the ion mobility range intended for use in the study. For proteomics experiments, we typically use an ion mobility range from 0.7 to 1.3 1/K₀, hence the 1/K₀ start and end values can be set to 0.7 and 1.3, respectively. This consistency in ion mobility range allows for the integration of dda-PASEF quality control (QC) runs into the sample table as reference points without necessitating recalibration of the TIMS tunnel.\n",
       "2. To specifically calibrate a narrow ion mobility range, activate the locked sign at 1/K₀ end. Following this, adjust the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This alters the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀. The aim here is to shift the ion mobility range without modifying the interval, enabling all three calibrants to be used for calibration while maintaining a constant TIMS potential.\n",
       "3. Wait until the TIC in Chromatogram View is stable. This can take up to 15 minutes. Switch the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 1, and deactivate the polygon heatmap.\n",
       "4. In timsControl, navigate to 'calibration', then 'mobility'. From reference lists, select the list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' that contains the calibrant masses 622, 922, 1221. Then, specify the linear mode and 5% as detection range and ±0.1 Da as width.\n",
       "5. Proceed by selecting 'calibrate'. Deselect all calibrants except 622, 922, and 1222 by right-clicking. To verify that the calibrants have been picked correctly at the center, click on them in the reference list. If they are not picked in the center, make adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window. If the score is at 100%, press accept.\n",
       "6. Adjust the ion mobility range to its original values, for instance 0.7-1.3 1/K₀, reset the scan mode, set MS averaging to 1, and reactivate the polygon heatmap.\n",
       "\n",
       "# Expected Results\n",

       "| A weak Tuning Mix calibrant signal | Over time, the calibrant signal of the Tuning Mix may weaken to a point where they are barely visible in the Mobilogram (TIMS View) and in the mass spectrum. | (1) Check if the UltraSource has the gas flow correctly set (Table 1). (2) Cancel the calibration, put the instrument in standby mode, disconnect the filter tubing from the UltraSource, and inject 5 to 10 µL (up to 40 µL) of Tuning Mix directly into the UltraSource. Reattach the filter tubing and switch the instrument into operating mode. Consider increasing the MS averaging value up to a maximum of 30. Repeat this step until a strong calibrant signal is observed and allow a 1-minute pause after each addition of Tuning Mix. The Tuning Mix signal should be more dominant than the signals of common contaminants and reach a signal intensity of around 5x10⁵. If a direct injection of in total 40 µL of Tuning Mix does not significantly enhance the Tuning Mix signal, this may suggest another issue. |\n",
