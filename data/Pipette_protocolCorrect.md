# Dispensing Protocol


## Abstract
This protocol describes how to pipette 20 uL buffer A in a PCR Plate from A1 to A12.


## Materials

### Equipment
- PCR Plate
- Pipette

### Reagents
- Formic acid (FA)
  ! CAUTION: This liquid may be corrosive. It is harmful and can cause damage if direct contact occurs.

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA. The buffers are stable for at least 6 months at room temperature as long as they are protected from sunlight.


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 1 minute*

1. Open the bottle of Buffer A.
2. Adjust the pipette to 20 μL setting.
3. Attach a pipette tip to the pipette.
4. Pipette 20 μL of Buffer A from the bottle into well A1.
5. Continue dispensing 20 μL of Buffer A into each consecutive well from A2 to A12.
6. Discard the used pipette tip in the appropriate waste container.


## Expected Results
Approximatly 20 uL liquid in A1 to A12 in a PCR Plate.
