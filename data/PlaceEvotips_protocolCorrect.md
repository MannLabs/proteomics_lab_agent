# Placing Evotips in Evotip Boxes on the Evosep One System


## Abstract
This protocol describes the proper procedure for inspecting Evotips and placing Evotips in Evotip boxes on the liquid chromatography system Evosep One.


## Materials

### Equipment
- Evotips
  - Single-use stage tips for sample injection
  - Rack layout: Two columns (left and right)
  - Left column (top to bottom): S1, S2, S3
  - Right column (top to bottom): S4, S5, S6
  - Within each box: Standard 96-well format with A1 (top left), A12 (top right), H12 (bottom right)
- Evotip Boxes
  - 96-well format (A1-H12) (Figure 1)
- Evosep One System
  - Liquid chromatography system

### Reagents
- Formic acid (FA)
  ! CAUTION: This liquid may be corrosive. It is harmful and can cause damage if direct contact occurs.

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA. The buffers are stable for at least 6 months at room temperature as long as they are protected from sunlight.


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: less than 1 minute*

1. Visually inspect the Evotip box intended for S1 to verify it's filled with Buffer A solution to a minimum depth of 1 cm. Verification of the Evotip box placed at S3 is not necessary as it will only contain blanks.
2. Place Evotip Box at S1 within the rack system of the Evosep instrument. Ensure each box is firmly seated in its designated position.
3. Place an empty Evotip Box for Blank tips at S3. Ensure each box is firmly seated in its designated position.
4. Inspect each Evotip before placement to verify its condition. Properly prepared Evotips should display a pale-colored SPE material disc with visible solvent above it (Figure 2).
   **CRITICAL STEP**: Discard any Evotips showing signs of dryness or displaying a white-colored disc, as these conditions indicate compromised functionality that could affect sample analysis.
5. Place the verified Evotips into the prepared Evotip boxes at S1 from A1 to A6.
6. Place empty Evotips, called Blanks, at S3 from A1 to A6.
7. Document the precise position of each placed Evotip.


## Expected Results
When the procedure is performed correctly, you should observe:
- Properly seated Evotip boxes in the rack system
- Visible Buffer A solution in boxes (1 cm depth)
- All non-blank Evotips showing pale-colored SPE material discs & clear solvent meniscus above each SPE disc of each Evotip
- Accurate documentation of tip positions: Evotips that are placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks placed at S3 from A1 to A6.
