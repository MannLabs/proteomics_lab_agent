# Dispensing Protocol


## Aim
Pipette 20 uL buffer A in a PCR Plate from A1 to A12.


## Materials

### Equipment
- PCR Plate
- Pipette

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA.


## Procedure
*Timing: 1 minute*

2. ⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order** Adjusted the pipette to 20 μL setting.
1. Opened the bottle of Buffer A.
3. Attached a pipette tip to the pipette.
4. ❌ **Error:** Pipetted 20 μL of Buffer A from the bottle into well B1 instead of A1
5. ❌ **Error:** Continueed dispensing 20 μL of Buffer A into consecutive wells from B2 to B10 and into B12. However it should have been pipetted in to row a. Additionally, they pipetted twice into B10, left out B11.
6. Discarded the used pipette tip in the appropriate waste container.


## Result
Approximatly 20 uL liquid in B1 to B9, 40 uL in B10, 20 uL in B12.
