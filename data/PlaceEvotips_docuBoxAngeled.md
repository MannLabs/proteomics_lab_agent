# Placing Evotips in Evotip Boxes on the Evosep One System

## Aim
Placing Evotips in Evotip boxes: Evotips with HeLa at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks placed at S3 from A1 to A6.


## Materials

### Equipment
- Evotips
- Evotip Boxes
- Evosep One System

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A:0.1% (vol/vol) FA


## Procedure
*Timing: less than 1 minute*

1. Verified that Evotip box is filled to a minimum depth of 1 cm with Buffer A solution.
2. ❌ **Error:** Placed Evotip Box at S1 within the rack system of the Evosep instrument, but did not ensure that box is firmly seated in its designated position. In fact, box is not properly seated and placed at an angle on the rack.
3. Placed an empty Evotip Box for Blank tips at S3. Ensured box is firmly seated in its designated position.
4. Inspected each Evotip before placement to verify its condition. All Evotips were properly prepared as they display a pale-colored SPE material disc with visible solvent above it. 
5. Placed the verified Evotips into the prepared Evotip boxes at S1 from A1 to A12.
6. Placed empty Evotips, called Blanks, at S3 from A1 to A12.
7. ❌ Omitted: Did not document the precise position of each placed Evotip during the recorded procedure.


## Results
- Did not check for visible Buffer A solution in boxes (1 cm depth)
- All non-blank Evotips showed pale-colored SPE material discs & clear solvent meniscus above each SPE disc of each Evotip
- Evotips were placed at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks placed at S3 from A1 to A6.
