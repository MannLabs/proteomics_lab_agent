# Dispensing Protocol

## Aim
Pipetting first 400 uL buffer A and then 100 uL buffer B in a Eppendorf tube.


## Materials

### Equipment
- Eppendorf tube
- Pipette

### Reagents
- Formic acid (FA)
  - ! CAUTION: This liquid may be corrosive. It is harmful and can cause damage if direct contact occurs.
- Acetonitrile
  - ! CAUTION: This liquid is highly flammable and can be harmful if contact occurs.

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA.
- Buffer B: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA/99.9% (vol/vol) acetonitrile.


## Procedure
*Timing: 1 minute*

2. ⚠️ **Deviation: Altered step order** & ❌ **Error:** Adjusted the pipette volume to 430 μL instead of 400 uL.
1. Opened the bottles of Buffer A and Buffer B.
3. Attached a pipette tip to the pipette.
4. Pipetted 430 μL of Buffer A from the bottle into the Eppendorf tube.
5. Adjusted the pipette to 100 μL setting.
6. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not discard the used pipette tip in the appropriate waste container.
7. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not attach a new pipette tip to the pipette.
8. Pipetted 100 μL of Buffer B from the bottle into the Eppendorf tube containing Buffer A.
9. Discarded the used pipette tip in the appropriate waste container.
10. Mixed the solution with a vortexer.
11. Labeled the Eppendorf tube.
11.1 ➕ **Added:** Closed the bottles of Buffer A and Buffer B.
11.2 ➕ **Added:** Tidied up the bench.


## Results
- 530 uL liquid are in the tube
