# Calibrate the TIMS device


## Aim
Calibrating a TIMS device in timsControl.


## Materials

### Software
timsControl 6.0


## Procedure
*Timing: 1.5 minutes*

1. ❌ **Omitted:** The action of loading a performance evaluation method was not observed in the video. The recording started with a method already loaded, displaying an ion mobility range with 1/K₀ Start at 0.70 and 1/K₀ End at 1.30.
2. Activated the locked sign at 1/K₀ end.
3. Adjusted the 1/K₀ start from 0.7 to 0.85. This altered the ion mobility range from 0.7-1.3 1/K₀ to 0.85-1.45 1/K₀.
4. ❌ **Omitted:** An explicit waiting period for the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) to stabilize was not observed within the video duration. The user proceeded while the TIC appeared to be fluctuating.
5. Switched the scan mode to 'MS', set MS averaging to 30 and kept the polygon heatmap deactivated.
6. In timsControl, navigated to 'calibration', then 'mobility'.
7. ❌ **Omitted:** The action of selecting the reference list '[ESI] Tuning Mix ES-TOF (ESI)' was not observed; this list was pre-selected upon opening the mobility calibration panel.
8. ❌ **Omitted:** The actions of specifying the 'Linear' mode, 5.0% detection range, and ±0.100 Da width were not observed; these parameters were pre-set upon opening the panel.
9. Proceeded by selecting 'calibrate'.
10. To verify that the calibrants had been picked correctly at the center, clicked on them in the reference list.
11. No adjustments by clicking on the peak in the TIMS view window were necessary.
12. When the score reached 100%, pressed accept.
13. **Cursor clicks not on video: Selected "Method" > "Load Recent", selected the same method** and then clicked "Discard changes" in the pop-up window.
14. Set MS averaging back to 1.


## Results
- The score in the tab "Calibration" was at 100%
