# Placing Evotips in Evotip Boxes on the Evosep One System

## Aim
Placing Evotips in Evotip boxes: Evotips with HeLa at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks placed at S3 from A1 to A6.


## Materials

### Equipment
- Evotips
- Evotip Boxes
- Evosep One System

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A:0.1% (vol/vol) FA


## Procedure
*Timing: less than 1 minute*

1. The Evotip box intended for S1 was verified to be filled with Buffer A solution by visual inspection. Verification was omitted for the box placed at S3 since it will only contain blanks.
2. Placed Evotip Box at S1 within the rack system of the Evosep instrument. Ensured box is firmly seated in its designated position.
3. Place an empty Evotip Box for Blank tips at S3. Ensured box is firmly seated in its designated position.
4. ❌ **Omitted:** Inspected only some of the Evotips before placement to verify its condition. Properly prepared Evotips should display a pale-colored SPE material disc with visible solvent above it. All Evotips were fine.
5. ❌ **Error:** Placed the verified Evotips into the prepared Evotip boxes at S1, but positioned them from B1 to B3 and B5 to B7.
6. Place empty Evotips, called Blanks, at S3 from A1 to A12.
7. ❌ Omitted: Did not document the precise position of each placed Evotip during the recorded procedure.


## Results
- Properly seated Evotip boxes in the rack system
- Visible Buffer A solution in boxes (1 cm depth)
- All non-blank Evotips showing pale-colored SPE material discs & clear solvent meniscus above each SPE disc of each Evotip
- Evotips that are placed at S1 from B1 to B3 and B5 to B7.
- Blanks placed at S3 from A1 to A6.
