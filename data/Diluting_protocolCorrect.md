# Dispensing Protocol

## Abstract
This protocol describes how to pipette first 400 uL buffer A and then 100 uL buffer B in a Eppendorf tube.


## Materials

### Equipment
- Eppendorf tube
- Pipette

### Reagents
- Formic acid (FA)
  - ! CAUTION: This liquid may be corrosive. It is harmful and can cause damage if direct contact occurs.
- Acetonitrile
  - ! CAUTION: This liquid is highly flammable and can be harmful if contact occurs.

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA.
- Buffer B: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA/99.9% (vol/vol) acetonitrile.


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 1 minute*

1. Open the bottles of Buffer A and Buffer B.
2. Adjust the pipette to 400 μL setting.
3. Attach a pipette tip to the pipette.
4. Pipette 400 μL of Buffer A from the bottle into the Eppendorf tube.
5. Adjust the pipette to 100 μL setting.
6. Discard the used pipette tip in the appropriate waste container.
7. Attach a pipette tip to the pipette.
8. Pipette 100 μL of Buffer B from the bottle into the Eppendorf tube.
9. Discard the used pipette tip in the appropriate waste container.
10. Mix the solution with a vortexer.
11. Lable the Eppendorf tube.


## Expected Results
Approximatly 500 uL liquid in the tube
