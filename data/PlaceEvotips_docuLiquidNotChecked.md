## Aim
Placing Evotips in Evotip boxes: Evotips with HeLa at S1 from A1 to A6 and blanks placed at S3 from A1 to A6.


## Materials

### Equipment
- Evotips
- Evotip Boxes
- Evosep One System

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A:0.1% (vol/vol) FA

## Procedure
*Timing: less than 1 minute*

1. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not verify that Evotip box is filled to a minimum depth of 1 cm with Buffer A solution.
2. Placed Evotip Box at S1 within the rack system of the Evosep instrument. Ensured box is firmly seated in its designated position.
3. Placed an empty Evotip Box for Blank tips at S3. Ensured box is firmly seated in its designated position.

5. Placed the verified Evotips into the prepared Evotip boxes at S1 from A1 to A6.
6. Placed empty Evotips, called Blanks, at S3 from A1 to A6.
7. ❌ Omitted: Did not document the precise position of each placed Evotip during the recorded procedure.


## Results
