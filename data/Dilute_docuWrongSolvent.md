# Dispensing Protocol

## Aim
Pipetting first 400 uL buffer A and then 100 uL buffer B in a Eppendorf tube.


## Materials

### Equipment
- Eppendorf tube
- Pipette

### Reagents
- Formic acid (FA)
  - ! CAUTION: This liquid may be corrosive. It is harmful and can cause damage if direct contact occurs.
- Acetonitrile
  - ! CAUTION: This liquid is highly flammable and can be harmful if contact occurs.

### Reagent setup
- Buffer A: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA.
- Buffer B: Consists of 0.1% (vol/vol) FA/99.9% (vol/vol) acetonitrile.


## Procedure
*Timing: 1 minute*

1. Opened the bottles of Buffer A and Buffer B.
2. Adjusted the pipette to 400 μL setting.
3. Attached a pipette tip to the pipette.
4. ❌ **Error:** Pipetted 400 μL of Buffer B from the bottle into the Eppendorf tube, but it should have been buffer A instead.
5. Adjusted the pipette to 100 μL setting.
6. Discarded the used pipette tip in the appropriate waste container.
7. Attached a new pipette tip to the pipette.
8. ❌ **Error:** Pipetted 100 μL of Buffer A from the bottle into the Eppendorf tube containing Buffer A, but it should have been buffer B instead. Additionally, there were bubbels in pipette tip.
9. Discarded the used pipette tip in the appropriate waste container.
10. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not mix the solution with a vortexer.
11. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not label the Eppendorf tube.


## Results
500 uL liquid in the tube but with reversed solvent composition than intented
