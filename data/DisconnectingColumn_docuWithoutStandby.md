# Disconnecting a IonOpticks column from an Evosep System

## Aim
Disconnecting an IonOpticks column from an Evosep liquid chromatography system while the column is installed in the UltraSource of a timsTOF mass spectrometer.


## Materials

### Equipment
- IonOpticks Column
- timsTOF Mass Spectrometer:
  - Equipped with UltraSource ion source
- Evosep One LC System
  - with sample line
- NanoViper Adapter (black)
- Pliers


## Procedure
*Timing: 1 minute*

### Verified timsTOF was in standby mode:
1. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not check the timsControl software status in top left corner.
2. ❌ **Omitted:** Skipped to click the power symbol to transition from "Operate" mode to "Standby" mode.

### Disconnected IonOpticks column and Evosep:
3. Opened the lid of the column oven.
4. Loosened the securing screw at the sample line - column connection by lifting it up and moved the metal grounding screw away from the column-sample line connection.
5. Attached the NanoViper adapter to the sample line for easier handling.
6. Held the column fitting with pliers for easier handling.
7. Unscrewed the NanoViper connector to detach the sample line from the IonOpticks column by turning it counter clock-wise.
8. Positioned the sample line without bending it by placing it over the transparent bumper of the Evosep.


## Results
- The timsTOF status, "Operate" or "Standby", is unclear
- The column was completely detached from the Evosep
