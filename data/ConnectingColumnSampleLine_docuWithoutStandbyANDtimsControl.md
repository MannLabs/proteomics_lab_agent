# Connecting IonOpticks Column & sample line of Evosep

## Aim
Connecting an IonOpticks column inserted into a timsTOF Ultra with an sample line of an Evosep.


## Materials

### Equipment
- IonOpticks Column
- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer
  - Equipped with UltraSource ion source
  - Equipped with column oven for temperature control
- Evosep One LC System
  - with sample line
- NanoViper Adapter (black)
- Pliers


## Procedure
*Timing: 3 minutes*

1. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not verify that the instrument was in standing by mode.

### Connected column and sample line
2. Verified that an IonOpticks column was already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.
3. Attached a black NanoViper adapter to the LC sample line.
4. Removed any excess liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line by snipping it off.
5. Held the column fitting of the IonOpticks column with pliers.
6. Hand-tightened the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting.
7. Removed the NanoViper adapter.
8. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not draw the oven closer to the UltraSource or secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven.
9. Lifted and placed the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.
10. Closed the lid of the oven.
10.1 ➕ **Added:** Connected the oven to the electrical power supply.
11. Verified the temperature was at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven.

### Switched timsTOF to operate and idle flow
12. ❌ **Omitted:** Skipped to transition the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button in timsControl.
13. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not navigate to Hystar and ensure that the idle flow was active.
14. ❌ **Omitted:** Did not return to timsControl to check the MS signal.
