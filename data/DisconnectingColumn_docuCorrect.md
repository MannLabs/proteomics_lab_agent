# Disconnecting a IonOpticks column from an Evosep System

## Aim
Disconnecting an IonOpticks column from an Evosep liquid chromatography system while the column is installed in the UltraSource of a timsTOF mass spectrometer.


## Materials

### Equipment
- IonOpticks Column
- timsTOF Mass Spectrometer:
  - Equipped with UltraSource ion source
- Evosep One LC System
  - with sample line
- NanoViper Adapter (black)
- Pliers


## Procedure
Timing: 1 minute

### Verified timsTOF was in standby mode:
1. Checked timsControl software status in top left corner.
2. Since it was in "Operate" mode, clicked the power symbol to transition to "Standby" (Figure 1, top left).

### Disconnected IonOpticks column and Evosep:
3. Opened the lid of the column oven.
4. Loosened the securing screw at the sample line - column connection. Lifted it up and moved the metal grounding screw away from the column-sample line connection.
5. Attached the NanoViper adapter to the sample line for easier handling.
6. Held the column fitting with pliers for easier handling.
7. Unscrewed the NanoViper connector to detach the sample line from the IonOpticks column by turning it counter clock-wise.
8. Positioned the sample line ensuring it formed a gentle curve. Placed it over the transparent bumper of the Evosep.


## Results
- The column was completely detached from the Evosep
- The timsTOF remained in standby mode
