# Change source: UltraSource to ESI source


## Aim
Switching from the UltraSource to the ESI source.


## Materials

### Equipment
- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer:
  - Equipped with an UltraSource ion source
  - ESI source on the side to attach


## Procedure
**Estimated timing: less than 10 minute**

### Switch TimsControl to 'Standby' mode
1. Verified that the IonOpticks column from an Evosep System was disconnected.
2. In timsControl, verified that the software was in standby mode.
3. Navigated to the 'Source', then proceeded to 'SourceType' and selected 'ESI'. Did not activate the source at this moment.

### Remove UltraSource
4. Disconnected the power supply of the oven.
5. Disconnected the filter tubing.
6. Rotated the top right and bottom left handles of the UltraSource housing by 180 degrees.
7. Slid off the UltraSource housing from both the source door and the glass capillary.
8. Set the UltraSource housing on the bench.
9. Removed the source door by opening it and unhinging it, similar to the motion of a normal door.
10. Set it aside.

### Mount Apollo ESI source
11. Put on gloves.
12. Attached the capillary cap securely to the glass capillary and the spray shield to the desolvation stage housing.
13. Hinged the ESI source into position as if it were a door and closed it.
14. Connected the sample inlet of the ESI source and the peak tubing lines, which originated from the syringe, by turning it clockwise.
15. Connected the nebulizer gas inlet to the N₂ line.

### Prepare the setup by loading the syringe with Tuning Mix
16. Removed old solvent.
17. Withdrew new Tuning Mix liquid.
18. Ensured it was devoid of air bubbles.
19. Connected the syringe to the peak tubing of the sample line.
20. Mounted this syringe within the external syringe pump setup. The golden button allowed movement of the syringe holder to arrange the syringe as in Figure 3.
21. Pressed some solvent out of the syringe to fill the sample line.

### Switch TimsControl to 'Operate' mode
22. Activated the ESI source within the TimsControl software.
23. Transitioned the instrument into 'operate' mode by clicking on the on/off symbol.
24. Began flow at the syringe, ensuring that the following settings were in place in the tab 'Source': Syringe: Hamilton 500 µL; Flow Rate: 3 µL/min. Pressed start. Kept the button next to start/stop pressed until a signal was observed in the 'Chromatogram View' and 'TIMS View' windows, which happened within 30 seconds.


## Results
- Signal intensity reached approximately 1.5x10^7
- Stable signal was observed in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)
