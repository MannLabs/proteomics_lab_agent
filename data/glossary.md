# Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA)
- A scan mode where a mass spectrometer acquires first a survey scan (MS1) to find the precursors for selection
- Selects the most abundant precursor ions for fragmentation and MS/MS analysis
- The selection of precursors is based on their intensity in the initial full scan
- Examples of DDDA methods include dda-PASEF

# Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA)
- A scan mode that acquires fragment ion spectra (MS2) for all precursor ions within a defined m/z range
- Does not require prior selection of specific precursors
- Examples of DIA methods include SWATH-MS and dia-PASEF

# PASEF (Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation)
- In timsControl, PASEF stands for the scan mode dda-PASEF of timsTOF mass spectrometers
- Utilizes trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) to accumulate and analyze many ions in parallel
- Enables rapid and efficient data acquisition in proteomics experiments

# Precursor Ion
- An ion selected for fragmentation in tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
- Typically a peptide ion

# Fragment Ion
- An ion produced by the fragmentation of a precursor ion during MS/MS analysis
- Provides information about the amino acid sequence of the precursor peptide

# m/z
- Mass-to-charge ratio
- A fundamental measure in mass spectrometry
- Represents the mass of an ion divided by its charge

# Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS)
- An analytical technique that separates ions based on their size and shape
- Ions are separated by their mobility through a gas under the influence of an electric field
- Adds an additional dimension of separation to mass spectrometry

# Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS)
- A specific type of ion mobility spectrometry
- Ions are trapped and then released sequentially based on their mobility
- Often used in combination with PASEF

# Collision Cross Section (CCS)
- A measure of the size and shape of an ion in the gas phase
- Determined through ion mobility spectrometry

# Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (QTOF)
- A type of mass spectrometer
- Uses a quadrupole mass filter to select precursor ions
- Measures the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions using a time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer

# Spectral Library
- A collection of previously acquired and identified MS/MS spectra which are assigned to peptide sequences
- Contains information about peptide sequences, retention times, and other relevant parameters
- Used in targeted data analysis and DIA

# Retention Time (RT)
- The time at which a particular analyte elutes from a chromatographic column
- A crucial parameter for identifying and quantifying peptides

# MaxQuant
- A software package for the analysis of mass spectrometry data
- Commonly used for label-free quantification and protein identification

# AlphaDIA
- An open-source software package for the analysis of DIA data

# False Discovery Rate (FDR)
- A statistical measure
- Controls the proportion of incorrect identifications (false positives) in a dataset

# Orbitrap
- A high-resolution mass analyzer
- Measures the m/z of ions based on their oscillation frequency in an electrostatic field


# TIMS Scan
- A data structure generated during a TIMS-MS cycle
- Represents the ion mobility distribution of ions within a specific time interval

# MS1 scan
- A full mass scan that measures the m/z values of all ions present in the sample

# MS2 scan or MS/MS scan
- A mass scan that measures the m/z values of fragment ions generated by the fragmentation of precursor ions

# IonOpticks columns
- High-performance nanoflow chromatography columns
- Specifically designed for LC-MS proteomics applications
- Known for their high resolution and efficiency
