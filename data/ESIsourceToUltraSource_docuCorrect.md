# Change source: ESI source to UltraSource


## Aim
Switching from the ESI source to UltraSource.


## Materials

### Equipment
- timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer: 
  - Equipped with an ESI ion source
  - UltraSource ion source ready to attach
- IonOpticks Column
- Evosep One LC System with sample line
- NanoViper Adapter (black)
- Pliers


## Procedure
*5 minute*

Person wore gloves.

### Switch timsTOF to standby
1. Verified that the instrument was in standing by mode.
**3.** In the 'source' and 'source type' sections of timsControl, chose 'CaptiveSpray' but did not activate it yet.
2. Verified that the syringe was inactive in the tab 'Source' under 'Syringe Pump'.

### Remove ESI source
4. Disconnected the peak connector of the sample tubing.
5. Disconnected the nebulizer N₂ line.
6. Removed the source door. Hinged it out like a regular door.
7. **Omitted** Put on laboratory gloves.
8. Removed the spray shield, and capillary cap.
9. **Omitted** Inspected the capillary position. If it appeared to be partially pulled out, gently pushed it back into proper position without blocking the gas flow.

### Mount UltraSource
10. Hinged the UltraSource door in and closed it.
11. Slid the UltraSource housing onto the source door and secured it by flipping the handles located at the top right and bottom left by 180°.
12. Connected the filter tubing to the source.

### Connect column and sample line
13. IonOpticks column was already inserted into the UltraSource of the timsTOF Ultra.
14. Attached a black NanoViper adapter to the sample line.
15. Removed any access liquid at the top of the nanoViper of the sample line by snipping it off.
16. Held the column fitting of the IonOpticks column with pliers.
17. Hand-tightened the NanoViper of the LC sample line with the column fitting.
18. **Omitted** Drew the oven closer to the UltraSource, secured it with the screw on the bottom of the oven.
19. Removed the NanoViper adapter so that the oven could be tightly closed.
20. Lifted and placed the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.
21. Closed the lid of the oven.
22. Connected the oven to the electrical power supply.
23. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. Blinking light indicated that the oven was heating up.

### Switch timsTOF to operate and idle flow
24. In timsControl, activated the CaptiveSpray function.
**29.** Monitored the internal pressures in the timsTOF device. Adjusted the 'funnel pressure' wheel aiming for a 10 mbar funnel pressure.
25. Transitioned the instrument to the operation mode by using the on/off button.
26. **Omitted** Navigated to Hystar and ensured that the idle flow was active. If not right-clicked on the Evosep logo, choosing 'preparation', and then selecting 'idle flow' and 'Run'.
27. **Omitted** Returned to timsControl.
28. Checked the MS signal. It was around 2.5x10^7.


## Results
- In timsControl, signal intensity should be above 10^7
- Stable signal in in timsControl (in the windows for Mobilogram (timsView) and mass spectrum)
