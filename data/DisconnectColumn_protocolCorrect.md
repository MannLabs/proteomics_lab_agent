# Disconnecting a IonOpticks column from an Evosep System

## Abstract
This protocol describes how to disconnect an IonOpticks column from an Evosep liquid chromatography system when the column is installed in the UltraSource of a timsTOF mass spectrometer.


## Materials

### Equipment
- IonOpticks Column
- timsTOF Mass Spectrometer:
  - Equipped with UltraSource ion source
- Evosep One LC System
  - with sample line
- NanoViper Adapter (black)
- Pliers


## Procedure
*Estimated timing: 1 minute*

### Verify timsTOF is in standby mode:
1. Check timsControl software status in top left corner.
2. If in "Operate" mode, click the power symbol to transition to "Standby" (Figure 1, top left).

### Disconnect IonOpticks column and Evosep:
3. Open the lid of the column oven (column toaster).
4. Loosen the securing screw at the sample line - column connection (Figure 2F), which has the purpose to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven. Lift it up and move the metal grounding screw away from the column-sample line connection.
5. Attach the NanoViper adapter to the sample line for easier handling.
6. Hold the column fitting with pliers for easier handling.
7. Unscrew the NanoViper connector to detach the sample line from the IonOpticks column by turning it counter clock-wise.
8. Position the sample line ensuring it does not bend. One method is to place it over the transparent bumper of the Evosep.


## Expected Results
- The timsTOF is in standby mode
- The column should be completely detached from the Evosep
