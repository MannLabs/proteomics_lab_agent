The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n| Equipment | Description | Source/Cat.

System Preparation and State Verification**\n\na. In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.\n\nb. **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.\n\n**2. Physical Connection of the Column**\n\na. Wear clean laboratory gloves.\n\nb. Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.\n\nc. Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.\n\nd. Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.\n\ne. Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\n\n   > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\n\n**3. Positioning, Grounding, and Heating**\n\na. Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.\n\nb. Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.\n\nc. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.\n\nd. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.\n\n**4. Establishing Electrospray and Signal**\n\na. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.\n\nb. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.\n\nc. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.\n\nd. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.\n- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\n- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray. The system is now ready for data acquisition.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\n![Placeholder for an image showing the three key steps of the physical connection: (A) Holding the column fitting steady with pliers.

The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n| Equipment | Description | Source/Cat.

In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.\n2.  **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.\n\n### Physical Connection of the Column\n\n3.  Wear clean laboratory gloves.\n4.  Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.\n5.  Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.\n6.  Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.\n7.  Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\n\n    > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\n\n### Positioning, Grounding, and Heating\n\n8.  Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.\n9.  Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.\n10. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.\n11. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.\n\n### Establishing Electrospray and Signal\n\n12. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.\n13. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.\n14. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.\n15. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.\n- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\n- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray. The system is now ready for data acquisition.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\n![Placeholder for an image showing the three key steps of the physical connection: (A) Holding the column fitting steady with pliers.

The procedure is optimized for plasma samples and involves protein binding to functionally-specific magnetic beads, stringent washing steps to remove non-specific binders, and an efficient on-bead digestion using a Trypsin/Lys-C mixture. The resulting peptide mixture is suitable for direct analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach minimizes sample handling losses and is readily adaptable for various affinity-based proteomics workflows, such as targeted protein pulldowns or analysis of post-translationally modified sub-proteomes.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Magnetic separator:** A magnetic rack or device compatible with 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes or 96-well plates.\n- **Centrifuge:** A microcentrifuge capable of reaching at least 2,000 x g, preferably refrigerated.\n- **Thermomixer or Heat Block:** Capable of incubation at 37°C and 90°C with shaking.\n- **Pipettes:** A set of calibrated single-channel pipettes (e.g., P20, P200, P1000) and corresponding tips.\n- **Microcentrifuge tubes or 96-well plates:** Low-protein-binding 1.5 mL tubes or 96-well PCR/storage plates (e.g., Eppendorf, cat. no. 0030124332).\n\n### Reagents\n- **Magnetic Beads:** The choice of magnetic beads is dependent on the experimental goal (e.g., streptavidin-coated for biotinylated targets, antibody-conjugated for immunoprecipitation). The protocol assumes a slurry format.\n- **Human Plasma:** Collected in EDTA or citrate tubes. Can be used fresh or previously frozen at -80°C.\n    * **Optional:** Platelet-contaminated plasma can be used if relevant to the experimental question.\n- **Deionized, distilled water (ddH₂O):** Ultrapure, MS-grade.\n- **Binding/Wash Buffer:** This buffer is user-defined and dependent on the chemistry of the magnetic beads and the protein interaction being studied. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the beads or a validated buffer screen (e.g., \"Philipp's buffer screen\").\n- **Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB):** 100 mM Tris, 10 mM TCEP, 40 mM Chloroacetamide (CAA).\n    * To prepare 40 mL:\n        * Tris base: 526.6 mg\n        * Chloroacetamide (CAA): 149.6 mg ! **CAUTION:** CAA is toxic and a carcinogen. Handle with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).\n        * 0.5 M TCEP solution: 0.8 mL\n        * Add ddH₂O to a final volume of 40 mL.\n    * **Alternative preparation from solids:** Combine Tris and CAA as above, then add 114.7 mg of TCEP-HCl. Adjust pH to ~8.0-8.5 before adding water to the final volume. **CRITICAL** Always verify the pH after preparation.\n- **Trypsin, MS-grade:** (e.g., Promega, cat. no. V5111). Resuspend to a stock concentration of 0.5 µg/µL in a suitable buffer (e.g., 50 mM acetic acid).\n- **Lys-C, MS-grade:** (e.g., Promega, cat. no. V1671). Resuspend to a stock concentration of 0.5 µg/µL in a suitable buffer (e.g., ddH₂O).\n- **Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA):** (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 28904). Prepare a 0.2% (v/v) solution in ddH₂O. ! **CAUTION:** TFA is corrosive. Handle in a fume hood with appropriate PPE.\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: ~1.5 hours hands-on time, ~12-18 hours for overnight digestion.*\n\n### Bead Preparation and Protein Binding\n*Timing: ~45 minutes*\n\n1.  In a microcentrifuge tube, aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry.\n2.  Place the tube on a magnetic separator. Once the beads are captured and the supernatant is clear, carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant.\n3.  Wash the beads by removing the tube from the magnet, adding 200 µL of ddH₂O, and gently resuspending the beads.\n4.  Recapture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant. Repeat this wash step once for a total of two washes.\n5.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the user-defined Binding/Wash Buffer.\n6.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.\n    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Ensure plasma is fully thawed and vortexed before addition. If starting with frozen plasma, centrifuge at high speed (e.g., 14,000 x g, 10 min, 4°C) to pellet any cryoprecipitates and use the clear supernatant.\n7.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking in a thermomixer to facilitate protein binding.\n\n### Washing\n*Timing: ~15 minutes*\n\n8.  Following incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube at 2,000 x g for 1 minute to pellet the beads.\n    * **Alternative:** Use a magnetic separator to capture the beads. Centrifugation is recommended to ensure collection of all beads.\n9.  Place the tube on the magnetic separator, allow the beads to be captured, and carefully discard the supernatant.\n10. Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer and gently resuspending.\n11. Capture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant.\n12. Repeat steps 10-11 once for a total of two washes. After the final wash, remove the supernatant as completely as possible.\n    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Complete removal of the wash buffer is essential to avoid interfering with the subsequent digestion step. Use a small-volume pipette tip to remove any residual liquid after the main aspiration.\n\n### On-Bead Digestion\n*Timing: ~25 minutes hands-on, 4 hours to overnight for digestion*\n\n13. Resuspend the washed beads in 50 µL of Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB).\n14. Incubate the sample for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking in a thermomixer to denature, reduce, and alkylate the bound proteins.\n15. After incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube to collect any condensate from the lid and walls. Let the sample cool to room temperature (~5-10 minutes).\n16. Prepare a fresh Trypsin/Lys-C enzyme master mix. For each sample, combine:\n    * Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB): 8 µL\n    * Trypsin stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL\n    * Lys-C stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL\n    * *Note: Prepare a master mix for all samples, including a 10% excess to account for pipetting inaccuracies. For example, for 10 samples, mix 88 µL LDB, 11 µL Trypsin, and 11 µL Lys-C.*\n17. Add 10 µL of the enzyme master mix to each sample. The total volume is now ~60 µL.\n18. Digest the proteins by incubating the samples overnight (12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking.\n    * **PAUSE POINT:** The digestion time can be optimized. A shorter digestion of 4 hours may be sufficient for some applications.\n\n### Sample Acidification and Peptide Collection\n*Timing: ~10 minutes*\n\n19. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample. Mix well by pipetting up and down. The final volume will be approximately 110 µL.\n20. Place the tubes on the magnetic separator to capture the beads.\n21. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which now contains the digested peptides, to a fresh, clean 96-well plate or microcentrifuge tube. Discard the plate/tubes containing the beads. The sample is now ready for LC-MS/MS analysis or further fractionation.\n\n## Expected Results\n-   Starting with 10 µL of human plasma, this enrichment and digestion procedure is expected to yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides in the final 110 µL volume.\n-   A standard injection volume for LC-MS/MS analysis would be 20 µL of the final peptide solution, corresponding to a load of approximately 150-160 ng of peptides on the column.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Workflow for On-Bead Digestion of Plasma Proteins\n[Placeholder for a flowchart diagram illustrating the main steps: (A) Bead Washing, (B) Protein Binding from Plasma, (C) Post-binding Washes, (D) On-bead Lysis and Digestion, and (E) Peptide Elution and Collection.]\n\nDo you have any corrections or feedback on this protocol?"

The procedure involves protein binding, washing, on-bead lysis with simultaneous reduction and alkylation, followed by enzymatic digestion. The resulting peptide mixture is suitable for subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n-   Pipettes (P10, P200, P1000) and corresponding pipette tips\n-   Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL) or a 96-well plate\n-   Magnetic rack compatible with tubes or plates\n-   Thermomixer or heat block capable of reaching 90°C with shaking\n-   Centrifuge (for plates or tubes)\n\n### Reagents\n-   Magnetic beads (e.g., MagResyn HILIC, ReSyn Biosciences)\n-   Human plasma\n-   **Binding/Wash Buffer:** The composition is dependent on the specific application or bead manufacturer's instructions.\n-   **Lysis Buffer (100 mM Tris, 40 mM CAA, 10 mM TCEP):** To prepare 40 mL, combine:\n    -   526.6 mg Tris base\n    -   149.6 mg 2-chloroacetamide (CAA)\n    -   0.8 mL of 0.5 M TCEP solution, or 100.1 mg of solid TCEP\n    -   Adjust to a final volume of 40 mL with ddH₂O.\n    ! **CRITICAL STEP:** If using solid TCEP, verify and adjust the pH of the final buffer to ~8.0.\n-   **Enzymes:** Sequencing-grade Trypsin and Lys-C protease stocks (e.g., 0.5 µg/µL).\n-   **Digestion Mix:** Prepare fresh before use. For each sample, mix:\n    -   8 µL Lysis Buffer\n    -   1 µL Trypsin stock\n    -   1 µL Lys-C stock\n-   **Acidification Solution:** 0.2% (v/v) Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in ddH₂O.\n-   Double-distilled water (ddH₂O)\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 1.5 hours + overnight digestion*\n\n### Bead Preparation and Protein Binding\n1.  Aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry into a microcentrifuge tube or well of a 96-well plate.\n2.  Place the tube/plate on a magnetic rack to capture the beads. Once the supernatant is clear, carefully remove and discard it.\n3.  Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of ddH₂O, resuspending, capturing the beads on the magnetic rack, and discarding the supernatant. Repeat this step once for a total of two washes.\n4.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the selected Binding/Wash Buffer.\n5.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.\n6.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking to facilitate protein binding.\n\n### Washing and On-Bead Digestion\n7.  Following incubation, capture the beads on the magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\n8.  Wash the beads twice with 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer per wash. For each wash, resuspend the beads completely before capturing them on the magnet and discarding the supernatant.\n9.  Add 50 µL of Lysis Buffer to the washed beads.\n10. Incubate for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking. This step lyses the bound proteins and simultaneously performs reduction and alkylation.\n11. Briefly centrifuge the tube/plate to collect condensation, then allow it to cool to room temperature.\n12. Add 10 µL of the freshly prepared Digestion Mix to each sample.\n13. Incubate overnight (e.g., 12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking to digest the proteins.\n\n### Peptide Recovery\n14. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample and mix well by pipetting. The final volume is approximately 110 µL.\n15. Place the tube/plate on the magnetic rack to capture the beads.\n16. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which contains the final peptide solution, to a fresh tube or plate for LC-MS analysis. Discard the plate containing the residual beads.\n\n## Expected Results\n-   Processing 10 µL of plasma with this method should yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides.\n-   For a standard LC-MS analysis, loading 20 µL of the final 100 µL peptide solution corresponds to an injection of approximately 160 ng of peptide material.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Workflow for Magnetic Bead-Based Proteomic Sample Preparation\n[Placeholder for a diagram illustrating the key steps: (A) Bead washing and protein binding from plasma.

Aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry into a microcentrifuge tube or well of a 96-well plate.\n2.  Place the tube/plate on a magnetic rack to capture the beads. Once the supernatant is clear, carefully remove and discard it.\n3.  Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of ddH₂O, resuspending, capturing the beads on the magnetic rack, and discarding the supernatant. Repeat this step once for a total of two washes.\n4.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the selected Binding/Wash Buffer.\n5.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.\n6.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking to facilitate protein binding.\n\n### Washing and On-Bead Digestion\n7.  Following incubation, capture the beads on the magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\n8.  Wash the beads twice with 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer per wash. For each wash, resuspend the beads completely before capturing them on the magnet and discarding the supernatant.\n9.  Add 50 µL of Lysis Buffer to the washed beads.\n10.

Incubate overnight (e.g., 12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking to digest the proteins.\n\n### Peptide Recovery\n14. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample and mix well by pipetting. The final volume is approximately 110 µL.\n15.

The process involves preparing the instrument, making a fluidic connection between the LC sample line and the column, and ensuring the column is correctly installed, grounded, and heated within the integrated column oven. Proper execution of these steps is fundamental for achieving stable electrospray and high-quality proteomic data.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Mass Spectrometer:** Bruker timsTOF series (e.g., SCP, Pro 2, Ultra) equipped with an UltraSource and integrated column oven.\n- **LC System:** An LC system capable of delivering nano-flow rates, such as the Evosep One.\n- **Capillary Column:** An electrospray-compatible capillary column with an integrated emitter (e.g., IonOpticks Aurora Series).\n- **Fittings and Adapters:**\n    - Nano-connector adapter (for tightening)\n    - Appropriate column inlet fitting compatible with the sample line.\n- **Tools:**\n    - Pliers\n    - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Nitrile gloves.\n- **Software:**\n    - Bruker timsControl\n    - Bruker HyStar\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 3-5 minutes*\n\n### System Preparation\n1.  Verify that the capillary column is already seated in the column holder of the UltraSource.\n2.  Navigate to the Bruker timsControl software. In the 'Automation' panel, confirm the mass spectrometer is in **Standby** mode.\n    > **CRITICAL STEP** If the instrument is in 'Operate' mode, click the button to switch it to **Standby** before proceeding. Leaving columns with flow while the source is active but not analyzing can compromise column performance.\n\n### Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\n3.  Attach the nano-connector adapter to the fitting on the LC sample line.\n4.  If necessary, ensure the end of the sample line tubing is free of excess liquid to create a clean, zero-dead-volume connection.\n5.  Hold the column's inlet fitting stationary using pliers.\n6.  Carefully insert the sample line fitting into the column's inlet and tighten until **finger-tight**.\n    > **CRITICAL STEP** Do not over-tighten the connection, as this can damage the column's port or the fitting. A gentle, snug fit is sufficient.\n7.  Remove the nano-connector adapter from the sample line fitting.\n\n### Installing and Securing the Column\n8.  Ensure the column oven assembly is positioned as close as possible to the ion source inlet. Adjust using the positional locking screw if necessary.\n9.  Confirm that the column's metal fitting makes firm contact with the grounding screw on the column oven. This is essential for a stable electrospray voltage.\n10. Close the cover of the column oven until it clicks securely into place.\n11. Observe the green LED indicators on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink during heat-up and become solid once the set temperature (e.g., 50 °C) is reached.\n\n### Final Checks and System Activation\n12.

The process involves preparing the instrument, making a fluidic connection between the LC sample line and the column, and ensuring the column is correctly installed, grounded, and heated within the integrated column oven. Proper execution of these steps is fundamental for achieving stable electrospray and high-quality proteomic data.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Mass Spectrometer:** Bruker timsTOF series (e.g., SCP, Pro 2, Ultra) equipped with an UltraSource and integrated column oven.\n- **LC System:** An LC system capable of delivering nano-flow rates, such as the Evosep One.\n- **Capillary Column:** An electrospray-compatible capillary column with an integrated emitter (e.g., IonOpticks Aurora Series).\n- **Fittings and Adapters:**\n    - Nano-connector adapter (for tightening)\n    - Appropriate column inlet fitting compatible with the sample line.\n- **Tools:**\n    - Pliers\n    - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Nitrile gloves.\n- **Software:**\n    - Bruker timsControl\n    - Bruker HyStar\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 3-5 minutes*\n\n### System Preparation\n1.  Verify that the capillary column is already seated in the column holder of the UltraSource.\n2.  Navigate to the Bruker timsControl software. In the 'Automation' panel, confirm the mass spectrometer is in **Standby** mode.\n    > **CRITICAL STEP** If the instrument is in 'Operate' mode, click the button to switch it to **Standby** before proceeding. Leaving columns with flow while the source is active but not analyzing can compromise column performance.\n\n### Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\n3.  Attach the nano-connector adapter to the fitting on the LC sample line.\n4.  If necessary, ensure the end of the sample line tubing is free of excess liquid to create a clean, zero-dead-volume connection.\n5.  Hold the column's inlet fitting stationary using pliers.\n6.  Carefully insert the sample line fitting into the column's inlet and tighten until **finger-tight**.\n    > **CRITICAL STEP** Do not over-tighten the connection, as this can damage the column's port or the fitting. A gentle, snug fit is sufficient.\n7.  Remove the nano-connector adapter from the sample line fitting.\n\n### Installing and Securing the Column\n8.  Ensure the column oven assembly is positioned as close as possible to the ion source inlet. Adjust using the positional locking screw if necessary.\n9.  Confirm that the column's metal fitting makes firm contact with the grounding screw on the column oven. This is essential for a stable electrospray voltage.\n10. Close the cover of the column oven until it clicks securely into place.\n11. Observe the green LED indicators on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink during heat-up and become solid once the set temperature (e.g., 50 °C) is reached.\n\n### Final Checks and System Activation\n12. Return to the Bruker timsControl software and click the **Standby** button to switch the mass spectrometer to **Operate** mode.\n13. Switch to the Bruker HyStar software. Verify that an 'Idle Flow' method is active to deliver solvent through the column. If not, right-click in the 'Method' tab, select **Idle Flow**, and run the procedure.\n14. Switch back to the timsControl software and confirm that a stable ion signal is being acquired, visible in the 'Spectrum View' or 'Chromatogram View'.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A physically secure, leak-free connection between the LC sample line and the capillary column.\n- The column oven cover is closed, and the temperature indicator LEDs show that the setpoint temperature is being reached or maintained.\n- Upon activation, the mass spectrometer's software shows a stable electrospray signal, indicating successful installation and operation.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: Software Status Check\n[Placeholder for a screenshot of the Bruker timsControl software interface, with an arrow pointing to the 'Automation' panel to highlight the 'Standby'/'Operate' status button (0:19).]\n\n### Figure 2: Finger-Tightening the Fluidic Connection\n[Placeholder for an image demonstrating the correct way to connect the sample line to the column.

                "text": "Here is the protocol generated from the video:\n\n***\n\n# **Connecting an IonOpticks Column to a Bruker timsTOF SCP Mass Spectrometer**\n\n## **Abstract**\nThis protocol details the precise procedure for installing an IonOpticks nano-flow chromatography column onto a Bruker timsTOF SCP mass spectrometer equipped with a CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source and a heated column oven. The protocol covers the initial software status check, the physical fluidic and electrical connection of the column, and the subsequent system activation to establish a stable electrospray for LC-MS/MS analysis. This procedure is fundamental for routine operation in high-sensitivity proteomics workflows utilizing the Evosep One and timsTOF platform.\n\n## **Materials**\n\n### **Equipment**\n- **Mass Spectrometer:** Bruker timsTOF SCP, equipped with a CaptiveSpray Ultra ion source.\n- **LC System:** Evosep One chromatography system.\n- **Column:** IonOpticks Aurora Series UHPLC column (as shown).\n- **Column Oven:** Integrated heated column oven assembly for the CaptiveSpray source.\n- **Pliers:** Small, flat-nosed pliers for providing counter-torque.\n- **Gloves:** Powder-free nitrile gloves.\n- **Fittings:**\n    - Sample transfer line from the Evosep One.\n    - Temporary tightening adapter tool (gold-colored, optional but recommended).\n\n### **Software**\n- Bruker timsControl (version shown is for a timsTOF SCP)\n- Bruker HyStar\n\n## **Procedure**\n*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n\n### **System Preparation**\n1. Verify the status of the mass spectrometer in the Bruker timsControl software. If the system is in 'Operating' mode (indicated by a green status light), switch it to 'Standby'. To do this, click the 'HyStar' button in the 'Automation' pane, which will reveal the 'Switch to Standby and Queue' option. Click this to place the instrument in a safe state for maintenance.\n    **! CAUTION** Do not perform any physical manipulations on the ion source or column while the instrument is in 'Operating' mode due to high voltages.\n2. Confirm that the IonOpticks column is correctly pre-installed in the heated column oven, with the emitter tip properly positioned within the CaptiveSpray source interface.\n\n### **Column Fluidic Connection**\n3. Ensure the tip of the sample transfer line from the Evosep One is clean. If necessary, use a clean, lint-free wipe to gently clean the tip.\n4. If using a tightening adapter tool, attach it to the end of the sample transfer line fitting.\n5. Carefully align the sample transfer line fitting with the threaded inlet of the IonOpticks column.\n6. Use pliers to gently hold the column's metal fitting to provide counter-torque and prevent it from rotating.\n    **CRITICAL** Do not use the pliers to tighten the connection, only to hold the column fitting stationary. Over-tightening can permanently damage the column.\n7. Using your fingers, screw the sample transfer line fitting into the column inlet until it is finger-tight. A snug connection is sufficient.\n8. Remove the temporary tightening adapter tool, if used.\n\n### **Column Positioning and Grounding**\n9. Verify the position of the column oven. Loosen the adjustment thumbscrew if necessary and ensure the oven is positioned as close as possible to the ion source inlet without making physical contact.\n10. Check that the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal fitting of the column. Proper grounding is essential for a stable electrospray.\n11. Close the black plastic cover of the column oven until it clicks securely into place.\n12. Observe the status LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will indicate that the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). A blinking light signifies that the target temperature has not yet been reached.\n\n### **System Activation and Verification**\n13. In the timsControl software, switch the mass spectrometer from 'Standby' to 'Operating' mode by clicking the 'HyStar' button.\n14. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software to manage the Evosep One LC system.\n15. Verify that the 'Idle Flow' is active. The instrument status for the Evosep One should indicate \"Idle flow\". If it is not running, right-click on the 'Evosep One' instrument in the instrument list, select 'Manual Control', and initiate the 'Flow to column (Idle flow)' method.\n16. Return to the timsControl software. Observe the 'Chromatogram View' and 'Spectrum View' to confirm that a stable signal is being acquired, which indicates a successful connection and stable electrospray.\n\n## **Expected Results**\n- A securely installed and grounded column with a leak-free fluidic connection.\n- The column oven will heat to and maintain its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\n- Upon system activation, a stable electrospray will be generated, resulting in a consistent signal (e.g., a stable Total Ion Chromatogram, or TIC) in the timsControl software.\n\n## **Figures**\n\n### **Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column**\n[Placeholder for an image showing a gloved hand finger-tightening the blue sample line onto the gold-colored column fitting, while pliers are used to gently hold the column fitting for counter-torque (as seen at 1:11 in the video).]\n\n### **Figure 2: Verifying Column Grounding and Position**\n[Placeholder for an image showing the installed column within the oven assembly, highlighting the grounding screw making contact with the column fitting and the thumbscrew for position adjustment (as seen at 1:43 in the video).]\n\n### **Figure 3: System Status Verification in Software**\n[Placeholder for a composite image showing (A) the Bruker timsControl interface in 'Operating' mode with a visible signal trace and (B) the Bruker HyStar interface confirming that 'Idle flow' is active for the Evosep One system (as seen at 2:27 and 2:39).]\n\n## **References**\n1.

                "text": "Here is the revised protocol with \"timsTOF SCP\" replaced by \"timsTOF Ultra\":\n\n***\n\n### **Step 1 & 2: Comprehensive Video Analysis & Observation Log**\n\n**Auditory Observations:**\n\n*   **0:01-0:08:** The researcher states their goal: to connect the column fitting to the sample line connector.\n*   **0:09-0:25:** The first step mentioned is checking the software status in `timsControl` and ensuring the instrument is in 'Standby' mode before proceeding.\n*   **0:26-0:35:** A critical warning is given: ion-optics columns should not be left with flow while the instrument is in standby, or in operate mode without flow for extended periods.\n*   **0:42-0:48:** The researcher confirms the protocol assumes the column is already inserted into the ion source, which is the current state.\n*   **0:51-1:23:** The process of connecting the sample line is narrated: attaching an adapter, snipping the capillary tip, using pliers to hold the column fitting steady, and hand-tightening the sample line connector until it is \\\"finger-tight.\\\" The adapter is then removed.\n*   **1:25-1:54:** The researcher explains how to check and adjust the column oven's position using a thumb screw to bring the emitter close to the source. They also point out the grounding screws.\n*   **1:58-2:13:** The researcher closes the column oven cover and explains that the blinking LEDs indicate the oven is heating to its setpoint (50 °C).\n*   **2:14-2:41:** The final steps are narrated: switching `timsControl` to 'Operate' mode, verifying that 'Idle Flow' is active in the `HyStar` software, and confirming the presence of a signal.\n\n**Visual Observations & Equipment Identification:**\n\n*   **Hardware:** The setup consists of a **Bruker timsTOF Ultra** mass spectrometer coupled to an **Evosep One** LC system. The researcher interacts with the integrated **Ion-Optics Column Oven** mounted on the MS ion source.\n*   **Tools:** The researcher wears black nitrile gloves and uses **pliers/cutters** to hold a fitting and trim a capillary. A temporary gold-colored **nano-connector adapter** is used for tightening.\n*   **Software:** The computer displays **Bruker timsControl** for MS operation and **Bruker HyStar** for LC control and sample queue management.\n*   **Actions (Chronological):**\n    1.  The researcher shows the sample line and the column fitting on the source (0:01).\n    2.  The `timsControl` software is shown, and the system is switched from 'Operating' to 'Standby' as a demonstration (0:18-0:25).\n    3.  An adapter is fitted to the sample line connector (0:56).\n    4.  The capillary tip is snipped for a clean cut (1:03).\n    5.  The sample line is hand-tightened onto the column fitting, which is held steady with pliers (1:06-1:18).\n    6.  The adapter is removed (1:22).\n    7.  The researcher demonstrates how to adjust the column oven position and points out grounding screws (1:34-1:53).\n    8.  The column oven cover is closed securely (1:59).\n    9.  Blinking green LEDs on the oven indicate it is heating up (2:05).\n    10. `timsControl` is switched to 'Operating' mode (2:22).\n    11. `HyStar` is checked to confirm 'Idle Flow' is on (2:26).\n    12. `timsControl` shows a stable ion signal, confirming a successful connection (2:38).\n\n### **Step 3: Nature-Style Protocol**\n\n# **Connecting an Ion-Optics Column to a timsTOF Mass Spectrometer**\n\n## **Abstract**\nThis protocol details the procedure for connecting an ion-optics nano-LC column to the ion source of a Bruker timsTOF Ultra mass spectrometer. The steps include preparing the system by setting it to standby mode, physically connecting the sample line to the column's integrated emitter, ensuring proper positioning and grounding within the column oven, and finally activating the system to verify a successful connection and stable electrospray.\n\n## **Materials**\n\n### **Equipment**\n- Bruker timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer (or compatible model)\n- Evosep One LC System (or compatible nano-LC)\n- Integrated Ion-Optics Column Oven\n- Ion-Optics nano-LC Column (packed emitter)\n- Pliers or capillary cutters\n- Nitrile gloves\n- Nano-connector adapter (for tightening, optional but recommended)\n\n### **Software**\n| Software | Purpose | Source/Provider |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Bruker timsControl | Mass spectrometer control and data visualization | Bruker Daltonics |\n| Bruker HyStar | LC system control and sample submission | Bruker Daltonics |\n\n### **Reagents**\n- Mobile phases A and B, as required by the specific LC method.\n\n## **Procedure**\n*Estimated timing: 5 minutes*\n\n### **Prepare the Mass Spectrometer**\n1.  In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the instrument status in the 'Automation' panel.\n2.  If the instrument is in 'Operating' mode, click the 'HyStar' button to switch the system to **'Standby by'**.\n    **! CAUTION:** Proceeding with column installation while the instrument is operating can damage the column and the instrument.\n\n### **Connect the Sample Line to the Column**\n3.  Ensure the ion-optics column is correctly inserted into the column oven stage.\n4.  To ensure a flush connection, trim the last millimeter of the sample line capillary using a clean cutter for a flat, perpendicular cut.\n5.  Hold the column fitting on the ion source steady with pliers.\n6.  Carefully align and hand-tighten the sample line nano-connector onto the column fitting. The connection should be finger-tight; do not over-tighten, as this can damage the fittings.\n\n### **Configure the Column Oven**\n7.  Adjust the position of the column oven stage using the side thumb screw to place the emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source inlet without physical contact.\n8.  Verify that the column is properly grounded. The grounding screw on the stage must be in firm contact with the column's conductive surface.\n9.  Close the column oven cover until it clicks securely into place.\n10. Confirm that the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C), as indicated by the status LEDs. Blinking LEDs signify heating; solid LEDs signify a stable temperature.\n\n### **Activate and Verify the System**\n11. In the `timsControl` software, click the 'HyStar' button to switch the instrument from 'Standby by' to **'Operating'** mode.\n12. Navigate to the Bruker `HyStar` software.\n13. Ensure that the LC 'Idle Flow' is active. If not, initiate it through the instrument control panel (e.g., right-click on instrument status > Preparation > Idle Flow Run).\n14. Return to the `timsControl` software. Monitor the 'Chromatogram View' and 'Spectrum View' to confirm that a stable ion signal is being generated.\n\n## **Expected Results**\n- A securely connected nano-LC column with proper grounding.\n- A column oven that is closed and has reached its set temperature.\n- A stable ion signal observed in the `timsControl` software, indicating a successful and stable electrospray.\n\n## **Figures**\n\n### **Figure 1: Column Connection**\n[Placeholder for an image showing the hand-tightening of the sample line to the column fitting, with pliers used to stabilize the source-side fitting (1:12).]\n\n### **Figure 2: Column Oven and Grounding**\n[Placeholder for an image of the closed column oven, highlighting the emitter position adjustment screw and the grounding screw contact point (1:37, 1:43).]\n\n### **Figure 3: Signal Verification**\n[Placeholder for a screenshot of the `timsControl` software displaying a stable chromatogram and mass spectrum after the connection is complete and the system is operating (2:39).]\n\n## **References**\n1.

The steps include preparing the system by setting it to standby mode, physically connecting the sample line to the column's integrated emitter, ensuring proper positioning and grounding within the column oven, and finally activating the system to verify a successful connection and stable electrospray.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- Bruker timsTOF Ultra Mass Spectrometer (or compatible model)\n- Evosep One LC System (or compatible nano-LC)\n- Integrated Ion-Optics Column Oven\n- Ion-Optics nano-LC Column (packed emitter)\n- Pliers or capillary cutters\n- Nitrile gloves\n- Nano-connector adapter (for tightening, optional but recommended)\n\n### Software\n| Software | Purpose | Source/Provider |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Bruker timsControl | Mass spectrometer control and data visualization | Bruker Daltonics |\n| Bruker HyStar | LC system control and sample submission | Bruker Daltonics |\n\n### Reagents\n- Mobile phases A and B, as required by the specific LC method.\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 5 minutes*\n\n### Prepare the Mass Spectrometer\n1. In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the instrument status in the 'Automation' panel.\n2. If the instrument is in 'Operating' mode, click the 'HyStar' button to switch the system to **'Standby by'**.\n    **! CAUTION:** Proceeding with column installation while the instrument is operating can damage the column and the instrument.\n\n### Connect the Sample Line to the Column\n3. Ensure the ion-optics column is correctly inserted into the column oven stage.\n4. To ensure a flush connection, trim the last millimeter of the sample line capillary using a clean cutter for a flat, perpendicular cut.\n5. Hold the column fitting on the ion source steady with pliers.\n6. Carefully align and hand-tighten the sample line nano-connector onto the column fitting. The connection should be finger-tight; do not over-tighten, as this can damage the fittings.\n\n### Configure the Column Oven\n7. Adjust the position of the column oven stage using the side thumb screw to place the emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source inlet without physical contact.\n8. Verify that the column is properly grounded. The grounding screw on the stage must be in firm contact with the column's conductive surface.\n9. Close the column oven cover until it clicks securely into place.\n10. Confirm that the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C), as indicated by the status LEDs. Blinking LEDs signify heating; solid LEDs signify a stable temperature.\n\n### Activate and Verify the System\n11. In the `timsControl` software, click the 'HyStar' button to switch the instrument from 'Standby by' to **'Operating'** mode.\n12. Navigate to the Bruker `HyStar` software.\n13. Ensure that the LC 'Idle Flow' is active. If not, initiate it through the instrument control panel (e.g., right-click on instrument status > Preparation > Idle Flow Run).\n14. Return to the `timsControl` software. Monitor the 'Chromatogram View' and 'Spectrum View' to confirm that a stable ion signal is being generated.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A securely connected nano-LC column with proper grounding.\n- A column oven that is closed and has reached its set temperature.\n- A stable ion signal observed in the `timsControl` software, indicating a successful and stable electrospray.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: Column Connection\n[Placeholder for an image showing the hand-tightening of the sample line to the column fitting, with pliers used to stabilize the source-side fitting (1:12).]\n\n### Figure 2: Column Oven and Grounding\n[Placeholder for an image of the closed column oven, highlighting the emitter position adjustment screw and the grounding screw contact point (1:37, 1:43).]\n\n### Figure 3: Signal Verification\n[Placeholder for a screenshot of the `timsControl` software displaying a stable chromatogram and mass spectrum after the connection is complete and the system is operating (2:39).]\n\n## References\n1.

                "text": "Here is the generated protocol:\n\n***\n\n# Connecting an IonOpticks Aurora Series Column to a Bruker timsTOF Mass Spectrometer\n\n## Abstract\nThis protocol details the procedure for connecting an IonOpticks Aurora Series column, housed in its integrated oven, to the CaptiveSpray ion source of a Bruker timsTOF series mass spectrometer. The steps cover the initial system state verification, the physical connection of the sample line to the column, proper positioning and grounding of the column oven, and the final verification of a stable electrospray signal. This procedure is essential for routine operation and maintenance when a new column is installed.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Mass Spectrometer:** Bruker timsTOF SCP (or compatible timsTOF model) equipped with a CaptiveSpray ion source.\n- **LC System:** Evosep One.\n- **Column:** IonOpticks Aurora Series column with integrated emitter.\n- **Column Heater:** IonOpticks column oven.\n- **Pliers:** Needle-nose or similar pliers for securely holding fittings.\n- **Gloves:** Standard laboratory nitrile gloves.\n\n### Software\n\n| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Bruker timsControl | Not specified in video | Control software for timsTOF series instruments | Provided with Bruker timsTOF systems |\n| Bruker HyStar | Not specified in video | Control software for the LC system (Evosep One) | Provided with Bruker chromatography systems |\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 5-10 minutes*\n\n### Prepare the Mass Spectrometer\n1. Navigate to the Bruker timsControl software.\n2. Verify the instrument status. In the 'Automation' panel, ensure the system is in **'Standby by'** mode. If the system is in **'Operating'** mode, click the button to switch it to **'Standby by'**.\n    ! **CAUTION** Handling the ion source components while the instrument is in 'Operating' mode exposes the user to high voltage. Always ensure the system is in 'Standby by' before proceeding.\n\n### Connect the Column to the Sample Line\n3. Ensure the IonOpticks column is correctly inserted into the column oven, which should be mounted on the CaptiveSpray source stage.\n4. Attach the sample line fitting from the LC to the column inlet fitting.\n    *CRITICAL STEP* To prevent twisting and breaking the delicate fused silica of the column, use pliers to gently but firmly hold the stationary metal fitting on the column itself.\n5. While holding the column fitting stationary with pliers, screw the mobile sample line fitting into the column fitting. Tighten until it is finger-tight. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the fittings and the column.\n6. Gently remove any temporary adapters used for guidance.\n\n### Position and Secure the Column Assembly\n7. Verify the position of the column oven. If necessary, loosen the thumbscrew on the mounting stage and adjust the oven so that the column's emitter tip is as close as possible to the ion source inlet without touching it.\n8. Ensure the column is properly grounded. Check that one of the grounding screws on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal fitting of the column.\n9. Close the cover of the column oven until it clicks securely into place.\n10. Confirm that the column oven is heating. The green LED indicators on the side of the oven will light up. A blinking light indicates the oven is actively heating to its setpoint (typically 50 °C).\n\n### Verify the Connection and Signal\n11. Return to the Bruker timsControl software and switch the instrument status from **'Standby by'** to **'Operating'**.\n12. Switch to the Bruker HyStar software to manage the LC system.\n13. Confirm that an 'Idle Flow' method is active on the Evosep One. This ensures that mobile phase is being delivered to the newly installed column. If not active, initiate the idle flow.\n14. Return to the timsControl software and monitor the 'Chromatogram View' and 'Spectrum View'. The presence of a stable signal (e.g., from the mobile phase background ions) confirms a successful connection and a stable electrospray.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A physically secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the column.\n- The column oven cover is closed, and the temperature indicator LEDs are active, signifying it is heating to the set temperature.\n- Upon switching the mass spectrometer to 'Operate' mode with LC flow, a stable ion signal is observed in the timsControl software, indicating a successful and stable electrospray.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\n[Placeholder for a close-up image showing the use of pliers to hold the column fitting stationary while the sample line fitting is being tightened by hand (1:07).]\n\n### Figure 2: Positioning and Grounding the Column Oven\n[Placeholder for an image illustrating the key adjustment and contact points on the column oven: (A) the positioning thumbscrew, and (B) the grounding screw making contact with the column fitting (1:41).]\n\n### Figure 3: Verifying the System Status and Signal\n[Placeholder for a composite image showing (A) the column oven with its green LED indicators lit (2:05) and (B) the Bruker timsControl software interface displaying a stable ion signal in the chromatogram and spectrum views after switching to 'Operating' mode (2:40).]\n\n## References\n1.

The steps cover the initial system state verification, the physical connection of the sample line to the column, proper positioning and grounding of the column oven, and the final verification of a stable electrospray signal. This procedure is essential for routine operation and maintenance when a new column is installed.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Mass Spectrometer:** Bruker timsTOF Ultra (or compatible timsTOF model) equipped with a CaptiveSpray ion source.\n- **LC System:** Evosep One.\n- **Column:** IonOpticks Aurora Series column with integrated emitter.\n- **Column Heater:** IonOpticks column oven.\n- **Pliers:** Needle-nose or similar pliers for securely holding fittings.\n- **Gloves:** Standard laboratory nitrile gloves.\n\n### Software\n\n| Software | Version | Purpose | Source/Link |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Bruker timsControl | Not specified in video | Control software for timsTOF series instruments | Provided with Bruker timsTOF systems |\n| Bruker HyStar | Not specified in video | Control software for the LC system (Evosep One) | Provided with Bruker chromatography systems |\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 5-10 minutes*\n\n### Prepare the Mass Spectrometer\n1. Navigate to the Bruker timsControl software.\n2. Verify the instrument status. In the 'Automation' panel, ensure the system is in **'Standby by'** mode. If the system is in **'Operating'** mode, click the button to switch it to **'Standby by'**\n    ! **CAUTION** Handling the ion source components while the instrument is in 'Operating' mode exposes the user to high voltage. Always ensure the system is in 'Standby by' before proceeding.\n\n### Connect the Column to the Sample Line\n3. Ensure the IonOpticks column is correctly inserted into the column oven, which should be mounted on the CaptiveSpray source stage.\n4. Attach the sample line fitting from the LC to the column inlet fitting.\n    *CRITICAL STEP* To prevent twisting and breaking the delicate fused silica of the column, use pliers to gently but firmly hold the stationary metal fitting on the column itself.\n5. While holding the column fitting stationary with pliers, screw the mobile sample line fitting into the column fitting. Tighten until it is finger-tight. Do not overtighten, as this can damage the fittings and the column.\n6. Gently remove any temporary adapters used for guidance.\n\n### Position and Secure the Column Assembly\n7. Verify the position of the column oven. If necessary, loosen the thumbscrew on the mounting stage and adjust the oven so that the column's emitter tip is as close as possible to the ion source inlet without touching it.\n8. Ensure the column is properly grounded. Check that one of the grounding screws on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal fitting of the column.\n9. Close the cover of the column oven until it clicks securely into place.\n10. Confirm that the column oven is heating. The green LED indicators on the side of the oven will light up. A blinking light indicates the oven is actively heating to its setpoint (typically 50 °C).\n\n### Verify the Connection and Signal\n11. Return to the Bruker timsControl software and switch the instrument status from **'Standby by'** to **'Operating'**.\n12. Switch to the Bruker HyStar software to manage the LC system.\n13. Confirm that an 'Idle Flow' method is active on the Evosep One. This ensures that mobile phase is being delivered to the newly installed column. If not active, initiate the idle flow.\n14. Return to the timsControl software and monitor the 'Chromatogram View' and 'Spectrum View'. The presence of a stable signal (e.g., from the mobile phase background ions) confirms a successful connection and a stable electrospray.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A physically secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the column.\n- The column oven cover is closed, and the temperature indicator LEDs are active, signifying it is heating to the set temperature.\n- Upon switching the mass spectrometer to 'Operate' mode with LC flow, a stable ion signal is observed in the timsControl software, indicating a successful and stable electrospray.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\n[Placeholder for a close-up image showing the use of pliers to hold the column fitting stationary while the sample line fitting is being tightened by hand (1:07).]\n\n### Figure 2: Positioning and Grounding the Column Oven\n[Placeholder for an image illustrating the key adjustment and contact points on the column oven: (A) the positioning thumbscrew, and (B) the grounding screw making contact with the column fitting (1:41).]\n\n### Figure 3: Verifying the System Status and Signal\n[Placeholder for a composite image showing (A) the column oven with its green LED indicators lit (2:05) and (B) the Bruker timsControl software interface displaying a stable ion signal in the chromatogram and spectrum views after switching to 'Operating' mode (2:40).]\n\n## References\n1.

                "text": "Here is the generated protocol based on the video:\n\n# Replacing the RF Generator Module in a Bruker timsTOF SCP Mass Spectrometer\n\n## Abstract\nThis protocol details the systematic procedure for replacing the radio frequency (RF) generator module within a Bruker timsTOF SCP mass spectrometer. The process involves a complete system shutdown, careful disconnection of specific cabling, removal of the faulty module, and installation of the replacement unit. This protocol is intended for trained service personnel or experienced users performing necessary hardware maintenance.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Bruker timsTOF SCP mass spectrometer**\n- **Replacement RF Generator Module** (Bruker, specific part number required)\n- **Screwdriver** (Phillips head, #2)\n- **Screwdriver** (Flathead, small)\n- **Anti-static wrist strap**\n  ! CAUTION: Electronic components are sensitive to electrostatic discharge. Always wear an anti-static wrist strap connected to a proper grounding point on the instrument chassis when handling internal electronics.\n\n### Software\n- **Bruker timsControl** (Version used for instrument control)\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 30 minutes*\n\n### System Shutdown\n1. In the timsControl software, place the mass spectrometer into **Shutdown** mode. Wait for the software to confirm the shutdown sequence is complete.\n2. Close the timsControl software application.\n3. Locate the main power supply unit at the rear of the instrument. Find the service switch, a small rocker switch typically located near a bank of green status LEDs.\n4. Flip the service switch to the \"0\" (Off) position.\n    **CRITICAL STEP** Verify that all but two of the green status LEDs on the power supply unit have turned off. This confirms that the main electronics are de-energized, while essential vacuum-related power remains.\n\n### Accessing the RF Generator Module\n5. Remove the rear and side panels of the mass spectrometer to access the internal electronics.\n6. Identify the RF generator module. It is a large, silver-colored rectangular unit located in the lower-middle section of the instrument's rear chassis.\n7. Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the two screws securing the metal shielding plate that covers the front of the RF generator module. Set the plate and screws aside.\n8. Remove the four screws (two on top, two on the bottom) that secure the front cover of the RF generator module.\n9. Carefully remove the cover to expose the main circuit board and its cable connections.\n\n### Removing the Old RF Generator Module\n10. Consult the provided diagram (see Figure 1) to identify and disconnect the eight cables from the circuit board in the following order:\n    - Two red-sheathed coaxial cables with screw-on connectors.\n    - Two black-sheathed coaxial cables with push-on connectors.\n    - One gold-plated coaxial cable with a screw-on connector.\n    - One large multi-pin power connector (white).\n    - One small multi-pin connector (white).\n    - One small multi-pin connector (black).\n11. Locate the black plastic release latch at the top rear of the module's housing.\n12. Push the latch firmly upward to disengage the module from the chassis.\n13. Grasp the module firmly and slide it straight out of the instrument chassis. Be mindful of surrounding cables to avoid snagging.\n14. Place the old module on an anti-static surface.\n\n### Installing the New RF Generator Module\n15. Unpack the new RF generator module and place it on an anti-static surface. Compare it with the old module to confirm it is the correct part.\n16. On the new module, ensure the release latch at the top rear is in the upward (unlocked) position.\n17. Carefully align the new module with the empty slot in the chassis and slide it straight in until it is fully seated.\n18. Push the release latch down until it clicks, securing the module in place.\n19. Reconnect the eight cables to their corresponding ports on the circuit board in the reverse order of removal. Ensure all connectors are firmly seated.\n20. Re-install the front cover of the RF generator module using its four screws.\n21. Re-install the outer metal shielding plate using its two screws.\n22. Flip the service switch on the main power supply back to the \"1\" (On) position.\n23. Re-install the instrument's side and rear panels.\n24. The instrument is now ready to be powered on via the timsControl software for system checks and calibration.\n\n## Expected Results\n- The new RF generator module is securely installed in the timsTOF SCP.\n- Upon powering on, the instrument initializes without errors related to the RF system.\n- Successful post-replacement calibration confirms the new module is functioning correctly.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: RF Generator Module Cable Connections\n[Placeholder for an annotated image of the RF generator circuit board, clearly labeling the eight cables to be disconnected (as seen at 6:39). Each cable type (coaxial, multi-pin) and its location should be highlighted.]\n\n### Figure 2: Releasing the RF Generator Module\n[Placeholder for an image or diagram demonstrating the two-step removal process: (A) Pushing the release latch upward (as seen at 7:37) and (B) Sliding the module out from the chassis (as seen at 7:53).]\n\n### Figure 3: Old and New RF Generator Modules\n[Placeholder for an image showing the old and new modules side-by-side on a workbench for comparison (as seen at 8:01).]\n\n## References\nThis procedure is based on the official Bruker service and maintenance guide for the timsTOF SCP.

The steps cover the physical connection of the liquid chromatography (LC) sample line to the column, proper installation and grounding within the column oven, and the subsequent software steps required to bring the integrated LC-MS system into an operational state for analysis. Adherence to this protocol is critical for establishing a stable electrospray and achieving optimal performance in high-sensitivity proteomics experiments.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Mass Spectrometer:** Bruker timsTOF SCP (or equivalent timsTOF series instrument) equipped with a nano-electrospray source (e.g., UltraSource).\n- **LC System:** Evosep One (or a compatible nano-flow LC system).\n- **Chromatography Column:** IonOpticks Aurora Series TS (or equivalent packed-emitter column).\n- **Column Oven:** Bruker-integrated or compatible column oven with temperature control and grounding contacts.\n- **Tools:**\n    - Small, flat-nosed pliers.\n    - Nano-connector adapter tool (for improved grip on the sample line fitting).\n- **Consumables:**\n    - Lint-free laboratory wipes.\n- **Computer and Software:**\n    - PC with Bruker timsControl and Bruker HyStar software installed.\n\n### Reagents\n- **Mobile Phase A:** LC-MS grade water with 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid.\n- **Mobile Phase B:** LC-MS grade acetonitrile with 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid.\n! **CAUTION** Formic acid is corrosive and causes severe skin burns and eye damage. Acetonitrile is a highly flammable liquid and vapor, and is harmful if swallowed, in contact with skin, or if inhaled. Handle all reagents in a well-ventilated area, wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 5 minutes*\n\n### System Preparation\n1.  In the Bruker timsControl software, verify that the mass spectrometer is in **Standby** mode. If the system is in 'Operate' mode, click the **To Standby** button.\n    > **CRITICAL STEP** For IonOpticks columns, which have no flow-switching valve, it is essential to ensure no mobile phase is flowing through the column when the mass spectrometer's source voltages are off (i.e., in Standby). Conversely, do not leave the column under flow for extended periods without the MS operating, as eluent can accumulate at the emitter tip.\n\n### Connecting the Sample Line\n2.  Ensure the packed-emitter column is already installed in the column oven, with the emitter tip correctly positioned within the ion source inlet.\n3.  Attach the nano-connector adapter tool to the metal fitting at the end of the LC sample line to facilitate easier handling and tightening.\n4.  Gently hold the stationary fitting of the chromatography column with a pair of pliers.\n5.  Carefully screw the sample line fitting onto the column fitting. Tighten by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\n    ! **CAUTION** Do not use the pliers to tighten the connection. Overtightening can strip the threads or damage the column's integrated union, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\n6.  Remove the nano-connector adapter tool from the sample line fitting.\n\n### Securing and Verifying the Column Installation\n7.  Check that the column oven assembly is positioned correctly, with the emitter tip as close as possible to the mass spectrometer's source inlet without touching it.\n8.  Ensure the column is properly grounded. Verify that the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal fitting of the column connection.\n9.  Close the lid of the column oven until it clicks securely into place.\n10. Confirm that the column oven begins heating. The status LEDs will typically blink during heat-up and become solid once the setpoint temperature (e.g., 50 °C) is reached.\n\n### System Activation and Equilibration\n11. Return to the timsControl software and click the **To Operate** button to switch the mass spectrometer into operational mode.\n12. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software. Verify that an **Idle Flow** method is active, delivering mobile phase to equilibrate the column.\n13. Observe the **Chromatogram View** and **Spectrum View** in timsControl. The appearance of a stable baseline and consistent calibrant peaks confirms that the system is operating correctly.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A physically secure, leak-free connection between the LC sample line and the chromatography column.\n- The column oven is closed and heated to the specified temperature (e.g., 50 °C).\n- The mass spectrometer is in 'Operate' mode, and the LC system is delivering a stable idle flow.\n- A stable signal trace (Total Ion Chromatogram) is visible in the timsControl software, indicating a successful and stable electrospray has been established.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: Connecting the LC Sample Line to the Column\n[Placeholder for a two-panel image showing (A) the researcher holding the column fitting with pliers while (B) hand-tightening the sample line fitting onto it.]\n\n### Figure 2: Final Column Installation Checks\n[Placeholder for a two-panel image showing (A) the closed column oven with the grounding screw properly engaged and (B) the blinking green LEDs indicating that the oven is heating to its setpoint.]\n\n### Figure 3: Software Verification of Operational Status\n[Placeholder for a screenshot of the Bruker timsControl software interface, showing the system status as 'Operating' and displaying a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and a representative mass spectrum.]\n\n## References\n1.

The steps cover the physical connection of the liquid chromatography (LC) sample line to the column, proper installation and grounding within the column oven, and the subsequent software steps required to bring the integrated LC-MS system into an operational state for analysis. Adherence to this protocol is critical for establishing a stable electrospray and achieving optimal performance in high-sensitivity proteomics experiments.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Mass Spectrometer:** Bruker timsTOF Ultra (or equivalent timsTOF series instrument) equipped with a nano-electrospray source (e.g., UltraSource).\n- **LC System:** Evosep One (or a compatible nano-flow LC system).\n- **Chromatography Column:** IonOpticks Aurora Series TS (or equivalent packed-emitter column).\n- **Column Oven:** Bruker-integrated or compatible column oven with temperature control and grounding contacts.\n- **Tools:**\n    - Small, flat-nosed pliers.\n    - Nano-connector adapter tool (for improved grip on the sample line fitting).\n- **Consumables:**\n    - Lint-free laboratory wipes.\n- **Computer and Software:**\n    - PC with Bruker timsControl and Bruker HyStar software installed.\n\n### Reagents\n- **Mobile Phase A:** LC-MS grade water with 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid.\n- **Mobile Phase B:** LC-MS grade acetonitrile with 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid.\n! **CAUTION** Formic acid is corrosive and causes severe skin burns and eye damage. Acetonitrile is a highly flammable liquid and vapor, and is harmful if swallowed, in contact with skin, or if inhaled. Handle all reagents in a well-ventilated area, wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 5 minutes*\n\n### System Preparation\n1.  In the Bruker timsControl software, verify that the mass spectrometer is in **Standby** mode. If the system is in 'Operate' mode, click the **To Standby** button.\n    > **CRITICAL STEP** For IonOpticks columns, which have no flow-switching valve, it is essential to ensure no mobile phase is flowing through the column when the mass spectrometer's source voltages are off (i.e., in Standby). Conversely, do not leave the column under flow for extended periods without the MS operating, as eluent can accumulate at the emitter tip.\n\n### Connecting the Sample Line\n2.  Ensure the packed-emitter column is already installed in the column oven, with the emitter tip correctly positioned within the ion source inlet.\n3.  Attach the nano-connector adapter tool to the metal fitting at the end of the LC sample line to facilitate easier handling and tightening.\n4.  Gently hold the stationary fitting of the chromatography column with a pair of pliers.\n5.  Carefully screw the sample line fitting onto the column fitting. Tighten by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\n    ! **CAUTION** Do not use the pliers to tighten the connection. Overtightening can strip the threads or damage the column's integrated union, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\n6.  Remove the nano-connector adapter tool from the sample line fitting.\n\n### Securing and Verifying the Column Installation\n7.  Check that the column oven assembly is positioned correctly, with the emitter tip as close as possible to the mass spectrometer's source inlet without touching it.\n8.  Ensure the column is properly grounded. Verify that the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal fitting of the column connection.\n9.  Close the lid of the column oven until it clicks securely into place.\n10. Confirm that the column oven begins heating. The status LEDs will typically blink during heat-up and become solid once the setpoint temperature (e.g., 50 °C) is reached.\n\n### System Activation and Equilibration\n11. Return to the timsControl software and click the **To Operate** button to switch the mass spectrometer into operational mode.\n12. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software. Verify that an **Idle Flow** method is active, delivering mobile phase to equilibrate the column.\n13. Observe the **Chromatogram View** and **Spectrum View** in timsControl. The appearance of a stable baseline and consistent calibrant peaks confirms that the system is operating correctly.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A physically secure, leak-free connection between the LC sample line and the chromatography column.\n- The column oven is closed and heated to the specified temperature (e.g., 50 °C).\n- The mass spectrometer is in 'Operate' mode, and the LC system is delivering a stable idle flow.\n- A stable signal trace (Total Ion Chromatogram) is visible in the timsControl software, indicating a successful and stable electrospray has been established.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: Connecting the LC Sample Line to the Column\n[Placeholder for a two-panel image showing (A) the researcher holding the column fitting with pliers while (B) hand-tightening the sample line fitting onto it.]\n\n### Figure 2: Final Column Installation Checks\n[Placeholder for a two-panel image showing (A) the closed column oven with the grounding screw properly engaged and (B) the blinking green LEDs indicating that the oven is heating to its setpoint.]\n\n### Figure 3: Software Verification of Operational Status\n[Placeholder for a screenshot of the Bruker timsControl software interface, showing the system status as 'Operating' and displaying a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and a representative mass spectrum.]\n\n## References\n1.
