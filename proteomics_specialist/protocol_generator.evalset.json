The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n| Equipment | Description | Source/Cat.

System Preparation and State Verification**\n\na. In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.\n\nb. **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.\n\n**2. Physical Connection of the Column**\n\na. Wear clean laboratory gloves.\n\nb. Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.\n\nc. Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.\n\nd. Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.\n\ne. Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\n\n   > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\n\n**3. Positioning, Grounding, and Heating**\n\na. Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.\n\nb. Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.\n\nc. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.\n\nd. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.\n\n**4. Establishing Electrospray and Signal**\n\na. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.\n\nb. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.\n\nc. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.\n\nd. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.\n- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\n- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray. The system is now ready for data acquisition.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\n![Placeholder for an image showing the three key steps of the physical connection: (A) Holding the column fitting steady with pliers.

The procedure ensures a secure, leak-free fluidic connection and proper grounding, which are essential for generating a stable electrospray. Additionally, the protocol outlines the necessary software commands in Bruker timsControl and HyStar to initiate mobile phase flow and confirm system readiness for data acquisition.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n| Equipment | Description | Source/Cat.

In the Bruker timsControl software, verify the status of the mass spectrometer. Ensure the instrument is in **‘Standby’** mode. If the status is ‘Operating’, click the corresponding button to switch it to ‘Standby’ before proceeding.\n2.  **CRITICAL STEP:** IonOpticks columns with integrated emitters should not be subjected to mobile phase flow for extended periods without an applied voltage (i.e., while the MS is in 'Standby'). This can lead to poor spray quality or column damage. Minimize the time between starting the idle flow and beginning the analysis.\n\n### Physical Connection of the Column\n\n3.  Wear clean laboratory gloves.\n4.  Confirm that the IonOpticks column is already seated correctly within the column oven of the CaptiveSpray Ultra source.\n5.  Carefully take the fused silica sample line originating from the LC system. Inspect the nano-connector at its tip and wipe it clean with a gloved finger or a lint-free wipe to remove any particulates or residual solvent.\n6.  Use pliers to gently but firmly grip the stationary metal fitting on the IonOpticks column. This prevents the column from twisting during tightening.\n7.  Align the sample line's nano-connector with the column fitting and carefully screw it in by hand until it is **finger-tight**.\n\n    > **! CAUTION:** Do not use tools to tighten the fitting and avoid overtightening. Overtightening can crush the capillary or damage the threads of the column fitting, leading to leaks and poor chromatographic performance.\n\n### Positioning, Grounding, and Heating\n\n8.  Verify the physical position of the column oven assembly. If necessary, loosen the positioning screw and adjust the assembly to bring the column's emitter tip as close as possible to the ion source's transfer capillary without touching it.\n9.  Ensure the grounding screw on the column oven is making firm contact with the metal column fitting. A proper electrical ground is essential for a stable electrospray. For longer columns, alternative grounding points on the oven assembly may be used.\n10. Close the lid of the column oven. A distinct click confirms it is securely shut.\n11. Observe the three green LEDs on the side of the column oven. The LEDs will blink while the oven is heating to its setpoint (e.g., 50 °C). The lights will become solid green once the target temperature has been reached and is stable.\n\n### Establishing Electrospray and Signal\n\n12. In the timsControl software, switch the instrument's status from **‘Standby’** to **‘Operating’**. This will apply the necessary voltages to the ion source.\n13. Navigate to the Bruker HyStar software.\n14. Initiate the mobile phase flow to the column. Right-click within the sample table and select **Idle flow > Run** from the context menu. This will start a low-flow rate to equilibrate the column and establish a spray.\n15. Return to the timsControl software. Monitor the **Chromatogram View** for a stable Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC) and the **Spectrum View** for a consistent ion signal.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A secure, leak-free connection between the sample line and the UHPLC column.\n- The column oven is closed and has reached its set temperature, indicated by solid green LEDs.\n- A stable TIC signal is observed in timsControl, confirming a robust and consistent electrospray. The system is now ready for data acquisition.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: Connecting the Sample Line to the Column\n![Placeholder for an image showing the three key steps of the physical connection: (A) Holding the column fitting steady with pliers.

The procedure is optimized for plasma samples and involves protein binding to functionally-specific magnetic beads, stringent washing steps to remove non-specific binders, and an efficient on-bead digestion using a Trypsin/Lys-C mixture. The resulting peptide mixture is suitable for direct analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach minimizes sample handling losses and is readily adaptable for various affinity-based proteomics workflows, such as targeted protein pulldowns or analysis of post-translationally modified sub-proteomes.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Magnetic separator:** A magnetic rack or device compatible with 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes or 96-well plates.\n- **Centrifuge:** A microcentrifuge capable of reaching at least 2,000 x g, preferably refrigerated.\n- **Thermomixer or Heat Block:** Capable of incubation at 37°C and 90°C with shaking.\n- **Pipettes:** A set of calibrated single-channel pipettes (e.g., P20, P200, P1000) and corresponding tips.\n- **Microcentrifuge tubes or 96-well plates:** Low-protein-binding 1.5 mL tubes or 96-well PCR/storage plates (e.g., Eppendorf, cat. no. 0030124332).\n\n### Reagents\n- **Magnetic Beads:** The choice of magnetic beads is dependent on the experimental goal (e.g., streptavidin-coated for biotinylated targets, antibody-conjugated for immunoprecipitation). The protocol assumes a slurry format.\n- **Human Plasma:** Collected in EDTA or citrate tubes. Can be used fresh or previously frozen at -80°C.\n    * **Optional:** Platelet-contaminated plasma can be used if relevant to the experimental question.\n- **Deionized, distilled water (ddH₂O):** Ultrapure, MS-grade.\n- **Binding/Wash Buffer:** This buffer is user-defined and dependent on the chemistry of the magnetic beads and the protein interaction being studied. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the beads or a validated buffer screen (e.g., \"Philipp's buffer screen\").\n- **Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB):** 100 mM Tris, 10 mM TCEP, 40 mM Chloroacetamide (CAA).\n    * To prepare 40 mL:\n        * Tris base: 526.6 mg\n        * Chloroacetamide (CAA): 149.6 mg ! **CAUTION:** CAA is toxic and a carcinogen. Handle with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).\n        * 0.5 M TCEP solution: 0.8 mL\n        * Add ddH₂O to a final volume of 40 mL.\n    * **Alternative preparation from solids:** Combine Tris and CAA as above, then add 114.7 mg of TCEP-HCl. Adjust pH to ~8.0-8.5 before adding water to the final volume. **CRITICAL** Always verify the pH after preparation.\n- **Trypsin, MS-grade:** (e.g., Promega, cat. no. V5111). Resuspend to a stock concentration of 0.5 µg/µL in a suitable buffer (e.g., 50 mM acetic acid).\n- **Lys-C, MS-grade:** (e.g., Promega, cat. no. V1671). Resuspend to a stock concentration of 0.5 µg/µL in a suitable buffer (e.g., ddH₂O).\n- **Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA):** (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 28904). Prepare a 0.2% (v/v) solution in ddH₂O. ! **CAUTION:** TFA is corrosive. Handle in a fume hood with appropriate PPE.\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: ~1.5 hours hands-on time, ~12-18 hours for overnight digestion.*\n\n### Bead Preparation and Protein Binding\n*Timing: ~45 minutes*\n\n1.  In a microcentrifuge tube, aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry.\n2.  Place the tube on a magnetic separator. Once the beads are captured and the supernatant is clear, carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant.\n3.  Wash the beads by removing the tube from the magnet, adding 200 µL of ddH₂O, and gently resuspending the beads.\n4.  Recapture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant. Repeat this wash step once for a total of two washes.\n5.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the user-defined Binding/Wash Buffer.\n6.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.\n    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Ensure plasma is fully thawed and vortexed before addition. If starting with frozen plasma, centrifuge at high speed (e.g., 14,000 x g, 10 min, 4°C) to pellet any cryoprecipitates and use the clear supernatant.\n7.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking in a thermomixer to facilitate protein binding.\n\n### Washing\n*Timing: ~15 minutes*\n\n8.  Following incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube at 2,000 x g for 1 minute to pellet the beads.\n    * **Alternative:** Use a magnetic separator to capture the beads. Centrifugation is recommended to ensure collection of all beads.\n9.  Place the tube on the magnetic separator, allow the beads to be captured, and carefully discard the supernatant.\n10. Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer and gently resuspending.\n11. Capture the beads on the magnetic separator and discard the supernatant.\n12. Repeat steps 10-11 once for a total of two washes. After the final wash, remove the supernatant as completely as possible.\n    * **CRITICAL STEP:** Complete removal of the wash buffer is essential to avoid interfering with the subsequent digestion step. Use a small-volume pipette tip to remove any residual liquid after the main aspiration.\n\n### On-Bead Digestion\n*Timing: ~25 minutes hands-on, 4 hours to overnight for digestion*\n\n13. Resuspend the washed beads in 50 µL of Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB).\n14. Incubate the sample for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking in a thermomixer to denature, reduce, and alkylate the bound proteins.\n15. After incubation, briefly centrifuge the tube to collect any condensate from the lid and walls. Let the sample cool to room temperature (~5-10 minutes).\n16. Prepare a fresh Trypsin/Lys-C enzyme master mix. For each sample, combine:\n    * Lysis and Digestion Buffer (LDB): 8 µL\n    * Trypsin stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL\n    * Lys-C stock (0.5 µg/µL): 1 µL\n    * *Note: Prepare a master mix for all samples, including a 10% excess to account for pipetting inaccuracies. For example, for 10 samples, mix 88 µL LDB, 11 µL Trypsin, and 11 µL Lys-C.*\n17. Add 10 µL of the enzyme master mix to each sample. The total volume is now ~60 µL.\n18. Digest the proteins by incubating the samples overnight (12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking.\n    * **PAUSE POINT:** The digestion time can be optimized. A shorter digestion of 4 hours may be sufficient for some applications.\n\n### Sample Acidification and Peptide Collection\n*Timing: ~10 minutes*\n\n19. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample. Mix well by pipetting up and down. The final volume will be approximately 110 µL.\n20. Place the tubes on the magnetic separator to capture the beads.\n21. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which now contains the digested peptides, to a fresh, clean 96-well plate or microcentrifuge tube. Discard the plate/tubes containing the beads. The sample is now ready for LC-MS/MS analysis or further fractionation.\n\n## Expected Results\n-   Starting with 10 µL of human plasma, this enrichment and digestion procedure is expected to yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides in the final 110 µL volume.\n-   A standard injection volume for LC-MS/MS analysis would be 20 µL of the final peptide solution, corresponding to a load of approximately 150-160 ng of peptides on the column.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Workflow for On-Bead Digestion of Plasma Proteins\n[Placeholder for a flowchart diagram illustrating the main steps: (A) Bead Washing, (B) Protein Binding from Plasma, (C) Post-binding Washes, (D) On-bead Lysis and Digestion, and (E) Peptide Elution and Collection.]\n\nDo you have any corrections or feedback on this protocol?"

The procedure involves protein binding, washing, on-bead lysis with simultaneous reduction and alkylation, followed by enzymatic digestion. The resulting peptide mixture is suitable for subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n-   Pipettes (P10, P200, P1000) and corresponding pipette tips\n-   Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL) or a 96-well plate\n-   Magnetic rack compatible with tubes or plates\n-   Thermomixer or heat block capable of reaching 90°C with shaking\n-   Centrifuge (for plates or tubes)\n\n### Reagents\n-   Magnetic beads (e.g., MagResyn HILIC, ReSyn Biosciences)\n-   Human plasma\n-   **Binding/Wash Buffer:** The composition is dependent on the specific application or bead manufacturer's instructions.\n-   **Lysis Buffer (100 mM Tris, 40 mM CAA, 10 mM TCEP):** To prepare 40 mL, combine:\n    -   526.6 mg Tris base\n    -   149.6 mg 2-chloroacetamide (CAA)\n    -   0.8 mL of 0.5 M TCEP solution, or 100.1 mg of solid TCEP\n    -   Adjust to a final volume of 40 mL with ddH₂O.\n    ! **CRITICAL STEP:** If using solid TCEP, verify and adjust the pH of the final buffer to ~8.0.\n-   **Enzymes:** Sequencing-grade Trypsin and Lys-C protease stocks (e.g., 0.5 µg/µL).\n-   **Digestion Mix:** Prepare fresh before use. For each sample, mix:\n    -   8 µL Lysis Buffer\n    -   1 µL Trypsin stock\n    -   1 µL Lys-C stock\n-   **Acidification Solution:** 0.2% (v/v) Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in ddH₂O.\n-   Double-distilled water (ddH₂O)\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 1.5 hours + overnight digestion*\n\n### Bead Preparation and Protein Binding\n1.  Aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry into a microcentrifuge tube or well of a 96-well plate.\n2.  Place the tube/plate on a magnetic rack to capture the beads. Once the supernatant is clear, carefully remove and discard it.\n3.  Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of ddH₂O, resuspending, capturing the beads on the magnetic rack, and discarding the supernatant. Repeat this step once for a total of two washes.\n4.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the selected Binding/Wash Buffer.\n5.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.\n6.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking to facilitate protein binding.\n\n### Washing and On-Bead Digestion\n7.  Following incubation, capture the beads on the magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\n8.  Wash the beads twice with 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer per wash. For each wash, resuspend the beads completely before capturing them on the magnet and discarding the supernatant.\n9.  Add 50 µL of Lysis Buffer to the washed beads.\n10. Incubate for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking. This step lyses the bound proteins and simultaneously performs reduction and alkylation.\n11. Briefly centrifuge the tube/plate to collect condensation, then allow it to cool to room temperature.\n12. Add 10 µL of the freshly prepared Digestion Mix to each sample.\n13. Incubate overnight (e.g., 12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking to digest the proteins.\n\n### Peptide Recovery\n14. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample and mix well by pipetting. The final volume is approximately 110 µL.\n15. Place the tube/plate on the magnetic rack to capture the beads.\n16. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which contains the final peptide solution, to a fresh tube or plate for LC-MS analysis. Discard the plate containing the residual beads.\n\n## Expected Results\n-   Processing 10 µL of plasma with this method should yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides.\n-   For a standard LC-MS analysis, loading 20 µL of the final 100 µL peptide solution corresponds to an injection of approximately 160 ng of peptide material.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Workflow for Magnetic Bead-Based Proteomic Sample Preparation\n[Placeholder for a diagram illustrating the key steps: (A) Bead washing and protein binding from plasma.

The procedure involves protein binding, washing, on-bead lysis with simultaneous reduction and alkylation, followed by enzymatic digestion. The resulting peptide mixture is suitable for subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n-   Pipettes (P10, P200, P1000) and corresponding pipette tips\n-   Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL) or a 96-well plate\n-   Magnetic rack compatible with tubes or plates\n-   Thermomixer or heat block capable of reaching 90°C with shaking\n-   Centrifuge (for plates or tubes)\n\n### Reagents\n-   Magnetic beads (e.g., MagResyn HILIC, ReSyn Biosciences)\n-   Human plasma\n-   **Binding/Wash Buffer:** The composition is dependent on the specific application or bead manufacturer\\'s instructions.\n-   **Lysis Buffer (100 mM Tris, 40 mM CAA, 10 mM TCEP):** To prepare 40 mL, combine:\n    -   526.6 mg Tris base\n    -   149.6 mg 2-chloroacetamide (CAA)\n    -   0.8 mL of 0.5 M TCEP solution, or 100.1 mg of solid TCEP\n    -   Adjust to a final volume of 40 mL with ddH₂O.\n    ! **CRITICAL STEP:** If using solid TCEP, verify and adjust the pH of the final buffer to ~8.0.\n-   **Enzymes:** Sequencing-grade Trypsin and Lys-C protease stocks (e.g., 0.5 µg/µL).\n-   **Digestion Mix:** Prepare fresh before use. For each sample, mix:\n    -   8 µL Lysis Buffer\n    -   1 µL Trypsin stock\n    -   1 µL Lys-C stock\n-   **Acidification Solution:** 0.2% (v/v) Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in ddH₂O.\n-   Double-distilled water (ddH₂O)\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 1.5 hours + overnight digestion*\n\n### Bead Preparation and Protein Binding\n1.  Aliquot 10 µL of the magnetic bead slurry into a microcentrifuge tube or well of a 96-well plate.\n2.  Place the tube/plate on a magnetic rack to capture the beads. Once the supernatant is clear, carefully remove and discard it.\n3.  Wash the beads by adding 100 µL of ddH₂O, resuspending, capturing the beads on the magnetic rack, and discarding the supernatant. Repeat this step once for a total of two washes.\n4.  Resuspend the washed beads in 100 µL of the selected Binding/Wash Buffer.\n5.  Add 10 µL of plasma to the bead suspension.\n6.  Incubate the mixture for 30 minutes at 37°C with gentle shaking to facilitate protein binding.\n\n### Washing and On-Bead Digestion\n7.  Following incubation, capture the beads on the magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\n8.  Wash the beads twice with 100 µL of Binding/Wash Buffer per wash. For each wash, resuspend the beads completely before capturing them on the magnet and discarding the supernatant.\n9.  Add 50 µL of Lysis Buffer to the washed beads.\n10. Incubate for 10 minutes at 90°C with shaking. This step lyses the bound proteins and simultaneously performs reduction and alkylation.\n11. Briefly centrifuge the tube/plate to collect condensation, then allow it to cool to room temperature.\n12. Add 10 µL of the freshly prepared Digestion Mix to each sample.\n13. Incubate overnight (e.g., 12-16 hours) at 37°C with gentle shaking to digest the proteins.\n\n### Peptide Recovery\n14. To stop the digestion, add 50 µL of 0.2% TFA solution to each sample and mix well by pipetting. The final volume is approximately 110 µL.\n15. Place the tube/plate on the magnetic rack to capture the beads.\n16. Carefully transfer 100 µL of the supernatant, which contains the final peptide solution, to a fresh tube or plate for LC-MS analysis. Discard the plate containing the residual beads.\n\n## Expected Results\n-   Processing 10 µL of plasma with this method should yield approximately 800 ng of total peptides.\n-   For a standard LC-MS analysis, loading 20 µL of the final 100 µL peptide solution corresponds to an injection of approximately 160 ng of peptide material.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Workflow for Magnetic Bead-Based Proteomic Sample Preparation\n[Placeholder for a diagram illustrating the key steps: (A) Bead washing and protein binding from plasma.
