                "text": "You are correct, I apologize for not finding the exact protocol you were looking for earlier.\n\nHere is the information for \"Connecting IonOpticks column & sample line\":\n\nThe page titled \"Connecting IonOpticks column & sample line\" contains following information:\n- Abstract\n- Materials\n- Equipment\n- Procedure:\n*Estimated timing: 3 minutes*\n### Verify timsTOF is in standby mode:\n1. Check timsControl software status in top left corner\n2. If in \"Operate\" mode, click the power symbol to transition to \"Standby\" (Figure 1, top left)\n\n### Connect IonOpticks column and sample line of Evosep:\n1. This protocol assumes that an **IonOpticks column is already inserted into the UltraSource** of the timsTOF Ultra. If not follow: TODO Protocol how to insert IonOpticks column\n2. Verify if the LC sample line has a black nano connector adapter attached. If not, locate an adapter and securely attach it to the sample line. The adapter facilitates proper gripping and tightening of the connection.\n3. Remove any access liquid at the top of the nano connector of the sample line for instance by using a spray duster.\n4. Hold the part of the nano fitting of the IonOpticks column with a pliers and hand-tighten the nano connector of the LC sample line (*Figure 1*).\n\n**CRITICAL STEP:** Be careful not to overtighten the connection between nano connector and nano fitting. Otherwise you can damage the column and the LC sample line.\n\n5. Draw the oven closer to the UltraSource, secure it with the screw on the bottom of the oven (*Figure 2*).\n6. Position the column to maximize enclosure within the oven. For IonOpticks columns, tighten the metal grounding screw at the column-sample line connection to establish proper ESI spray grounding with the column oven.\n7. Close the lid of the oven. The nano connector adapter of the sample line might have to be removed for short columns, such as the 8 cm column used for the 60 SPD Evosep method.\n8. Set the temperature at 50°C for IonOpticks columns, as indicated by three illuminated LEDs on the column oven. For changing temperature, press the button next to the LEDs.\n\n### Switch timsTOF to operate mode\n5. Go to ‘TimsControl’ and switch the instrument from ‘Standby’ to ‘Operate’ mode.\n\n**CRITICAL STEP:** Ensure that the IonOpticks column is not left connected to the LC for an extended period unless the mass spectrometer is in operate mode; otherwise, debris may accumulate on the emitter, lead to spitting.\n\n- Expected Results:\n* When timsControl is in operating mode again, a stable spray with a intensity 10^6-10^7 should be visible latest after 10 min after connection.\n* The pressure limits from table 1 should be applicable.\n\n- Figures:\n* Figure 1: Connection of a sample line of a LC system with a separation column and emitter\n* Figure 2: UltraSource\n\n- Tables:\n* Table 1: Regular column pressure in combination with the UltraSource and Evosep idle flow.\n| Column | Oven temperature [°C] | Pressure with 10 µm emitter [bar] |\n|---|---|---|\n| Aurora Elite nanoflow column (15 cm x 75 μm ID, 1.7 μm C18) for whisper40 | 50 | 230±20 |\n\n- References:\n1.
