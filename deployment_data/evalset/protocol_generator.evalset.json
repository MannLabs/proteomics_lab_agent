                "text": "Here is the generated protocol based on the video:\n\n# Replacing the RF Generator Module in a Bruker timsTOF SCP Mass Spectrometer\n\n## Abstract\nThis protocol details the systematic procedure for replacing the radio frequency (RF) generator module within a Bruker timsTOF SCP mass spectrometer. The process involves a complete system shutdown, careful disconnection of specific cabling, removal of the faulty module, and installation of the replacement unit. This protocol is intended for trained service personnel or experienced users performing necessary hardware maintenance.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Bruker timsTOF SCP mass spectrometer**\n- **Replacement RF Generator Module** (Bruker, specific part number required)\n- **Screwdriver** (Phillips head, #2)\n- **Screwdriver** (Flathead, small)\n- **Anti-static wrist strap**\n  ! CAUTION: Electronic components are sensitive to electrostatic discharge. Always wear an anti-static wrist strap connected to a proper grounding point on the instrument chassis when handling internal electronics.\n\n### Software\n- **Bruker timsControl** (Version used for instrument control)\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 30 minutes*\n\n### System Shutdown\n1. In the timsControl software, place the mass spectrometer into **Shutdown** mode. Wait for the software to confirm the shutdown sequence is complete.\n2. Close the timsControl software application.\n3. Locate the main power supply unit at the rear of the instrument. Find the service switch, a small rocker switch typically located near a bank of green status LEDs.\n4. Flip the service switch to the \"0\" (Off) position.\n    **CRITICAL STEP** Verify that all but two of the green status LEDs on the power supply unit have turned off. This confirms that the main electronics are de-energized, while essential vacuum-related power remains.\n\n### Accessing the RF Generator Module\n5. Remove the rear and side panels of the mass spectrometer to access the internal electronics.\n6. Identify the RF generator module. It is a large, silver-colored rectangular unit located in the lower-middle section of the instrument's rear chassis.\n7. Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the two screws securing the metal shielding plate that covers the front of the RF generator module. Set the plate and screws aside.\n8. Remove the four screws (two on top, two on the bottom) that secure the front cover of the RF generator module.\n9. Carefully remove the cover to expose the main circuit board and its cable connections.\n\n### Removing the Old RF Generator Module\n10. Consult the provided diagram (see Figure 1) to identify and disconnect the eight cables from the circuit board in the following order:\n    - Two red-sheathed coaxial cables with screw-on connectors.\n    - Two black-sheathed coaxial cables with push-on connectors.\n    - One gold-plated coaxial cable with a screw-on connector.\n    - One large multi-pin power connector (white).\n    - One small multi-pin connector (white).\n    - One small multi-pin connector (black).\n11. Locate the black plastic release latch at the top rear of the module's housing.\n12. Push the latch firmly upward to disengage the module from the chassis.\n13. Grasp the module firmly and slide it straight out of the instrument chassis. Be mindful of surrounding cables to avoid snagging.\n14. Place the old module on an anti-static surface.\n\n### Installing the New RF Generator Module\n15. Unpack the new RF generator module and place it on an anti-static surface. Compare it with the old module to confirm it is the correct part.\n16. On the new module, ensure the release latch at the top rear is in the upward (unlocked) position.\n17. Carefully align the new module with the empty slot in the chassis and slide it straight in until it is fully seated.\n18. Push the release latch down until it clicks, securing the module in place.\n19. Reconnect the eight cables to their corresponding ports on the circuit board in the reverse order of removal. Ensure all connectors are firmly seated.\n20. Re-install the front cover of the RF generator module using its four screws.\n21. Re-install the outer metal shielding plate using its two screws.\n22. Flip the service switch on the main power supply back to the \"1\" (On) position.\n23. Re-install the instrument's side and rear panels.\n24. The instrument is now ready to be powered on via the timsControl software for system checks and calibration.\n\n## Expected Results\n- The new RF generator module is securely installed in the timsTOF SCP.\n- Upon powering on, the instrument initializes without errors related to the RF system.\n- Successful post-replacement calibration confirms the new module is functioning correctly.\n\n## Figures\n\n### Figure 1: RF Generator Module Cable Connections\n[Placeholder for an annotated image of the RF generator circuit board, clearly labeling the eight cables to be disconnected (as seen at 6:39). Each cable type (coaxial, multi-pin) and its location should be highlighted.]\n\n### Figure 2: Releasing the RF Generator Module\n[Placeholder for an image or diagram demonstrating the two-step removal process: (A) Pushing the release latch upward (as seen at 7:37) and (B) Sliding the module out from the chassis (as seen at 7:53).]\n\n### Figure 3: Old and New RF Generator Modules\n[Placeholder for an image showing the old and new modules side-by-side on a workbench for comparison (as seen at 8:01).]\n\n## References\nThis procedure is based on the official Bruker service and maintenance guide for the timsTOF SCP.

Here is the generated protocol:\n\n# Automated High-Throughput Sample Preparation for Proteomics in 384-Well Plates\n\n## Abstract\nThis protocol details a high-throughput, automated method for preparing protein samples from cells or tissues in a 384-well plate format for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The workflow utilizes an automated liquid handling platform (e.g., Agilent Bravo) for precise reagent dispensing. The procedure includes detergent-based lysis at high temperature, a two-step enzymatic digestion with LysC and Trypsin, and subsequent sample cleanup and concentration using Evosep EvoTips. The resulting peptide samples are ready for direct analysis by nano-flow liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), particularly on systems like the Evosep One.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Automated Liquid Handler:** Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform or equivalent, equipped with a 96-well (ST) head.\n- **Microplate Centrifuge:** Capable of spinning 384-well plates at up to 2,000 x g.\n- **Centrifugal Vacuum Concentrator:** SpeedVac or equivalent, with a rotor for 384-well plates.\n- **PCR Thermocycler:** With a heated lid, compatible with 384-well PCR plates.\n- **384-well PCR Plates:** (e.g., Eppendorf, cat. no. 0030128648).\n- **Adhesive PCR Plate Seals:** Strong, pierceable foil seals (e.g., Thermo Fisher, cat. no.

W6-4).\n- **Lysyl Endopeptidase (LysC):** Mass spectrometry grade (e.g., Wako, cat. no. 125-05061). Reconstitute to 100 ng/µL in water.\n- **Trypsin:** Mass spectrometry grade (e.g., Promega, cat. no. V5111). Reconstitute to 100 ng/µL in water.\n- **Lysis Buffer (70 mM TEAB, 0.013% DDM):**\n    - To prepare 50 mL, combine 46.5 mL of LC-MS grade water, 3.5 mL of 1 M TEAB, and 650 µL of a 1% (w/v) DDM stock solution.\n    - *1% DDM Stock:* Dissolve 6.5 mg of DDM in 650 µL of LC-MS grade water.\n- **Digestion Buffer (4 ng/µL LysC, 6 ng/µL Trypsin):**\n    - Prepare fresh before use.\n    - To prepare 1 mL, combine 900 µL of Lysis Buffer, 40 µL of 100 ng/µL LysC stock, and 60 µL of 100 ng/µL Trypsin stock.\n- **Evosep Solution A (0.1% FA in water):** Add 1 mL of FA to 999 mL of LC-MS grade water.\n- **Evosep Solution B (0.1% FA in ACN):** Add 1 mL of FA to 999 mL of ACN.\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 2 days (includes overnight incubation)*\n\n**CRITICAL:** This protocol is optimized for an automated liquid handler. All dispense steps should be programmed accordingly, ensuring correct tip types, head configuration (e.g., 96-well or 384-well mode), and dispense positions are used for each step.\n\n### Day 1: Plate Preparation and Sample Lysis\n*Estimated timing: 2-3 hours*\n\n1.  Place your samples (e.g., single cells, tissue biopsies) into the wells of a 384-well PCR plate.\n2.  Seal the plate with an adhesive foil and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min to pellet the samples.\n3.  Carefully remove the seal.\n4.  **Plate Rinsing:** Using the automated liquid handler, perform four rinse cycles by dispensing 7 µL of 100% ACN into each well.\n5.  Seal the plate with a new adhesive foil and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min.\n6.  Carefully remove the seal. Dry the plate completely in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator at 45°C for approximately 30 min.\n7.  **Cell Lysis:** Using the automated liquid handler, add 7 µL of Lysis Buffer to each sample well.\n8.  Seal the plate securely with two layers of adhesive foil to prevent evaporation. Place metal weights on top of the plate if necessary.\n9.  Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 2 min to collect the liquid at the bottom of the wells.\n10. Place the plate in a PCR thermocycler and incubate with a heated lid using the appropriate program:\n    *   **For cells:** 95°C for 30 min.\n    *   **For tissues:** 95°C for 60 min.\n11. Allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n12. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min. Carefully remove the foil seals.\n13. **Protein Precipitation:** Add 1 µL of 100% ACN to each well.\n14. Reseal the plate with two new adhesive foils and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min.\n15. Place the plate back into the thermocycler and incubate with a heated lid:\n    *   **For cells:** 75°C for 30 min.\n    *   **For tissues:** 75°C for 60 min.\n16. Allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n17. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min before proceeding.\n\n### Day 1: Protein Digestion\n*Estimated timing: 30 minutes + overnight incubation*\n\n18. Carefully remove the foil seals.\n19. Using the automated liquid handler, add 2 µL of freshly prepared Digestion Buffer to each well. The total sample volume is now approximately 10 µL.\n20. Seal the plate with two new adhesive foils.\n21. Briefly centrifuge the plate (e.g., 15-second pulse) to ensure the enzyme mix combines with the sample lysate.\n22. Incubate the plate overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C in a PCR thermocycler with a heated lid.\n\n### Day 2: Sample Acidification and EvoTip Cleanup\n*Estimated timing: 1.5 hours*\n\n23. After overnight incubation, allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n24. Centrifuge the plate at 1,000 x g for 2 min.\n25. **Acidification:** Carefully remove the seals. Add 1.1 µL of 10% FA or TFA to each well to achieve a final concentration of approximately 1% and quench the digestion.\n26. Reseal the plate and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 2 min. The samples are now ready for solid-phase extraction.\n\n### Day 2: EvoTip Sample Loading\n27. Place the EvoTips in a compatible 96-well rack. Add 1-propanol to the bottom of the rack container to create a saturated atmosphere.\n28. **Activation:** Add 50 µL of 1-propanol to each EvoTip and let them soak for 3-5 minutes until the C18 material turns opaque.\n29. **Conditioning:** Centrifuge the EvoTips at 700 x g for 1 min to pass the 1-propanol through.\n30. Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution B to each tip. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min.\n31. Repeat step 30 one more time.\n32. **Equilibration:** Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min.\n33. Add 70 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge briefly (15-second \"pulse\" setting).\n    **CRITICAL STEP:** From this point forward, ensure the EvoTip packing material never runs dry. Keep the tips submerged in Evosep Solution A.\n34. **Sample Loading:** Place the EvoTip rack on top of your 384-well sample plate, aligning the tips with the sample wells.\n35. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min to load the entire sample volume (approx. 11 µL) onto the tips.\n36. To ensure complete sample transfer, add an additional 10 µL of Evosep Solution A to each sample well, and repeat the loading step (Step 35).\n37. **Wash:** Place the EvoTip rack over a waste container. Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip and centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min to wash away salts and contaminants.\n38. **Final Wash and Storage:** Add 100-150 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge briefly (15-second \"pulse\") to ensure the tips are filled with solution for storage. The loaded EvoTips can be sealed and stored at 4°C for several weeks.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A 384-well plate of digested peptides, acidified and ready for cleanup.\n- A corresponding rack of loaded EvoTips containing purified and concentrated peptides. The tips should be filled with Evosep Solution A, ensuring the C18 material remains wet. These tips are now ready for analysis on an Evosep One LC system coupled to a mass spectrometer.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Workflow Schematic\n[Placeholder for a diagram illustrating the major stages of the protocol: (A) Plate preparation and lysis in a 384-well plate.

                "text": "Thank you for the detailed feedback! I will now revise the protocol based on your corrections.\n\nHere is the updated protocol:\n\n# Automated High-Throughput Sample Preparation for Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) in 384-Well Plates\n\n## Abstract\nThis protocol details a high-throughput, automated method for preparing protein samples from cells or tissues in a 384-well plate format for mass spectrometry-based proteomics, specifically optimized for Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) workflows. The workflow utilizes automated liquid handling platforms (e.g., Agilent Bravo or MANTIS) for precise reagent dispensing. The procedure includes detergent-based lysis at high temperature, a two-step enzymatic digestion with LysC and Trypsin, and subsequent sample cleanup and concentration using Evosep EvoTips. The resulting peptide samples are ready for direct analysis by nano-flow liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), particularly on systems like the Evosep One.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Automated Liquid Handler:** Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform, MANTIS liquid handler, or equivalent, equipped with a 96-well (ST) head.\n- **Laser Micro Dissector:** For precise sample collection.\n- **Microplate Centrifuge:** Capable of spinning 384-well plates at up to 2,000 x g.\n- **Centrifugal Vacuum Concentrator:** SpeedVac or equivalent, with a rotor for 384-well plates.\n- **PCR Thermocycler:** With a heated lid, compatible with 384-well PCR plates.\n- **384-well PCR Plates.**\n- **Adhesive PCR Plate Seals:** Strong, pierceable foil seals.\n- **Reagent Reservoirs:** Compatible with the automated liquid handler.\n- **Pipettes and Tips:** Standard laboratory pipettes (P10, P200, P1000) and corresponding sterile tips.\n- **Evotips:** (Evosep).\n- **Metal Plates:** Two metal plates that fit between the 384-well plate and the PCR cycler to ensure even sealing.\n\n### Reagents\n! **CAUTION:** Handle all organic solvents and acids in a chemical fume hood. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and safety glasses.\n\n- **Triethylammonium Bicarbonate (TEAB):** 1 M stock solution, pH 8.5.\n- **n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltoside (DDM).**\n- **Acetonitrile (ACN):** LC-MS grade.\n- **Formic Acid (FA):** LC-MS grade.\n- **Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA):** LC-MS grade.\n- **1-Propanol:** LC-MS grade.\n- **Water:** LC-MS grade.\n- **Lysyl Endopeptidase (LysC):** Mass spectrometry grade. Reconstitute to 100 ng/µL in water.\n- **Trypsin:** Mass spectrometry grade. Reconstitute to 100 ng/µL in water.\n- **Lysis Buffer (70 mM TEAB, 0.013% DDM):**\n    - To prepare 1 mL, combine 917 µL of LC-MS grade water, 70 µL of 1 M TEAB, and 13 µL of a 1% (w/v) DDM stock solution.\n    - *1% DDM Stock:* Dissolve 6.5 mg of DDM in 650 µL of LC-MS grade water.\n- **Digestion Buffer (4 ng/µL LysC, 6 ng/µL Trypsin):**\n    - Prepare fresh before use.\n    - To prepare 1 mL, combine 900 µL of Lysis Buffer, 40 µL of 100 ng/µL LysC stock, and 60 µL of 100 ng/µL Trypsin stock.\n- **Evosep Solution A (0.1% FA in water):** Add 1 mL of FA to 999 mL of LC-MS grade water.\n- **Evosep Solution B (0.1% FA in ACN):** Add 1 mL of FA to 999 mL of ACN.\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 2 days (includes overnight incubation)*\n\n**CRITICAL:** This protocol is optimized for an automated liquid handler. All dispense steps should be programmed accordingly, ensuring correct tip types, head configuration (e.g., 96-well or 384-well mode), and dispense positions are used for each step.\n\n### Day 1: Plate Preparation and Sample Lysis\n*Estimated timing: 2-3 hours*\n\n1.  Collect your samples (e.g., single cells, tissue biopsies) using a laser micro dissector into the wells of a 384-well PCR plate.\n2.  Seal the plate with an adhesive foil and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min to pellet the samples.\n3.  Carefully remove the seal.\n4.  **Plate Rinsing:** Using the automated liquid handler, perform four rinse cycles by dispensing 7 µL of 100% ACN into each well.\n5.  Seal the plate with a new adhesive foil and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min.\n6.  Carefully remove the seal. Dry the plate completely in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator at 45°C for approximately 30 min.\n7.  **Cell Lysis:** Using the automated liquid handler, add 7 µL of Lysis Buffer to each sample well.\n8.  Seal the plate securely with two layers of adhesive foil to prevent evaporation. Place two metal plates on top of the plate if necessary, fitting them between the plate and the PCR cycler.\n9.  Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 2 min to collect the liquid at the bottom of the wells.\n10. Place the plate in a PCR thermocycler and incubate with a heated lid using the appropriate program:\n    *   **For cells:** 95°C for 30 min.\n    *   **For tissues:** 95°C for 60 min.\n11. Allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n12. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min. Carefully remove the foil seals.\n13. Add 1 µL of 100% ACN to each well.\n14. Reseal the plate with two new adhesive foils and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min.\n15. Place the plate back into the thermocycler, ensuring the two metal plates are placed on top if needed, and incubate with a heated lid:\n    *   **For cells:** 75°C for 30 min.\n    *   **For tissues:** 75°C for 60 min.\n16. Allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n17. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min before proceeding.\n\n### Day 1: Protein Digestion\n*Estimated timing: 30 minutes + overnight incubation*\n\n18. Carefully remove the foil seals.\n19. Using the automated liquid handler, add 2 µL of freshly prepared Digestion Buffer to each well. The total sample volume is now approximately 10 µL.\n20. Seal the plate with two new adhesive foils.\n21. Briefly centrifuge the plate (e.g., 15-second pulse) to ensure the enzyme mix combines with the sample lysate.\n22. Incubate the plate overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C in a PCR thermocycler with a heated lid, ensuring the two metal plates are placed on top if needed.\n\n### Day 2: Sample Acidification and EvoTip Cleanup\n*Estimated timing: 1.5 hours*\n\n23. After overnight incubation, allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n24. Centrifuge the plate at 1,000 x g for 2 min.\n25. **Acidification:** Carefully remove the seals. Add 1.1 µL of 10% FA or TFA to each well to achieve a final concentration of approximately 1% and quench the digestion.\n26. Reseal the plate and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 2 min. The samples are now ready for solid-phase extraction or can be frozen at -20°C for later use.\n\n### Day 2: EvoTip Sample Loading\n27. Place the EvoTips in a compatible 96-well rack. Fill the bottom of the container with 1-propanol. Soak the EvoTips in 1-propanol for 3-5 minutes until the C18 material turns opaque.\n28. **Conditioning:** Centrifuge the EvoTips at 700 x g for 1 min to pass the 1-propanol through.\n29. Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution B to each tip. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min.\n30. Repeat previous step.\n31. **Equilibration:** Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min.\n32. Add 70 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge briefly (15-second \"pulse\" setting).\n    **CRITICAL STEP:** From this point forward, ensure the EvoTip packing material never runs dry. Keep the tips submerged in Evosep Solution A.\n33. **Sample Loading:** Place the EvoTip rack on top of your 384-well sample plate, aligning the tips directly above the sample wells.\n34. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min to load the entire sample volume (approx. 11 µL) from the 384-well plate into the Evotips.\n35. To ensure complete sample transfer, add an additional 10 µL of Evosep Solution A to each sample well in the 384-well plate, and repeat the loading step (Step 34), transferring this wash volume to the same Evotips.\n36. **Wash:** Place the EvoTip rack over a waste container. Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip and centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min to wash away salts and contaminants.\n37. **Final Wash and Storage:** Add 100-150 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge briefly (15-second \"pulse\") to ensure the tips are filled with solution for storage. The loaded EvoTips can be sealed and stored at 4°C for several weeks.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A rack of loaded EvoTips containing purified and concentrated peptides. The tips should be filled with Evosep Solution A, ensuring the C18 material remains wet. These tips are now ready for analysis on an Evosep One LC system coupled to a mass spectrometer.\n\n## Figures\n### Figure 1: Workflow Schematic\n[Placeholder for a diagram illustrating the major stages of the protocol: (A) Plate preparation and lysis in a 384-well plate.

Incubate the plate overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C in a PCR thermocycler with a heated lid, ensuring the two metal plates are placed on top if needed.\n\n### Day 2: Sample Acidification and EvoTip Cleanup\n*Estimated timing: 1.5 hours*\n\n23. After overnight incubation, allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n24. Centrifuge the plate at 1,000 x g for 2 min.\n25. **Acidification:** Carefully remove the seals. Add 1.1 µL of 10% FA or TFA to each well to achieve a final concentration of approximately 1% and quench the digestion.\n26. Reseal the plate and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 2 min. The samples are now ready for solid-phase extraction or can be frozen at -20°C for later use.\n\n### Day 2: EvoTip Sample Loading\n27. Place the EvoTips in a compatible 96-well rack. Fill the bottom of the container with 1-propanol. Soak the EvoTips in 1-propanol for 3-5 minutes until the C18 material turns opaque.\n28. **Equilibration:** Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution B to each tip. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min.\n29. Repeat previous step.\n30. Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min.\n31. Add 70 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge briefly (15-second \"pulse\" setting).\n    **CRITICAL STEP:** From this point forward, ensure the EvoTip packing material never runs dry. Keep the tips submerged in Evosep Solution A.\n32. **Sample Loading:** Place the EvoTip rack on top of your 384-well sample plate, aligning the tips directly above the sample wells.\n33. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min to load the entire sample volume (approx. 11 µL) from the 384-well plate into the Evotips.\n34. To ensure complete sample transfer, add an additional 10 µL of Evosep Solution A to each sample well in the 384-well plate, and repeat the loading step (Step 33), transferring this wash volume to the same Evotips.\n35. **Wash:** Place the EvoTip rack over a waste container. Add 50 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip and centrifuge at 700 x g for 1 min to wash away salts and contaminants.\n36. **Final Wash and Storage:** Add 100-150 µL of Evosep Solution A to each tip. Centrifuge briefly (15-second \"pulse\") to ensure the tips are filled with solution for storage. The loaded EvoTips can be sealed and stored at 4°C for several weeks.\n\n## Expected Results\n- A rack of loaded EvoTips containing purified and concentrated peptides. The tips should be filled with Evosep Solution A, ensuring the C18 material remains wet. These tips are now ready for analysis on an Evosep One LC system coupled to a mass spectrometer.\n\n## References\n1. Mund, A., Coscia, F., & Mann, M. (2022).

The workflow utilizes automated liquid handling platforms (e.g., Agilent Bravo or MANTIS) for precise reagent dispensing. The procedure includes detergent-based lysis at high temperature, a two-step enzymatic digestion with LysC and Trypsin, and subsequent sample cleanup and concentration using Evosep EvoTips. The resulting peptide samples are ready for direct analysis by nano-flow liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), particularly on systems like the Evosep One.\n\n## Materials\n\n### Equipment\n- **Automated Liquid Handler:** Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform, MANTIS liquid handler, or equivalent, equipped with a 96-well (ST) head.\n- **Laser Micro Dissector:** For precise sample collection.\n- **Microplate Centrifuge:** Capable of spinning 384-well plates at up to 2,000 x g.\n- **Centrifugal Vacuum Concentrator:** SpeedVac or equivalent, with a rotor for 384-well plates.\n- **PCR Thermocycler:** With a heated lid, compatible with 384-well PCR plates.\n- **384-well PCR Plates.**\n- **Adhesive PCR Plate Seals:** Strong, pierceable foil seals.\n- **Reagent Reservoirs:** Compatible with the automated liquid handler.\n- **Pipettes and Tips:** Standard laboratory pipettes (P10, P200, P1000) and corresponding sterile tips.\n- **Evotips:** (Evosep).\n- **Metal Plates:** Two metal plates that fit between the 384-well plate and the PCR cycler to ensure even sealing.\n\n### Reagents\n! **CAUTION:** Handle all organic solvents and acids in a chemical fume hood. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and safety glasses.\n\n- **Triethylammonium Bicarbonate (TEAB):** 1 M stock solution, pH 8.5.\n- **n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltoside (DDM).**\n- **Acetonitrile (ACN):** LC-MS grade.\n- **Formic Acid (FA):** LC-MS grade.\n- **Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA):** LC-MS grade.\n- **1-Propanol:** LC-MS grade.\n- **Water:** LC-MS grade.\n- **Lysyl Endopeptidase (LysC):** Mass spectrometry grade. Reconstitute to 100 ng/µL in water.\n- **Trypsin:** Mass spectrometry grade. Reconstitute to 100 ng/µL in water.\n- **Lysis Buffer (70 mM TEAB, 0.013% DDM):**\n    - To prepare 1 mL, combine 917 µL of LC-MS grade water, 70 µL of 1 M TEAB, and 13 µL of a 1% (w/v) DDM stock solution.\n    - *1% DDM Stock:* Dissolve 6.5 mg of DDM in 650 µL of LC-MS grade water.\n- **Digestion Buffer (4 ng/µL LysC, 6 ng/µL Trypsin):**\n    - Prepare fresh before use.\n    - To prepare 1 mL, combine 900 µL of Lysis Buffer, 40 µL of 100 ng/µL LysC stock, and 60 µL of 100 ng/µL Trypsin stock.\n- **Evosep Solution A (0.1% FA in water):** Add 1 mL of FA to 999 mL of LC-MS grade water.\n- **Evosep Solution B (0.1% FA in ACN):** Add 1 mL of FA to 999 mL of ACN.\n\n## Procedure\n*Estimated timing: 2 days (includes overnight incubation)*\n\n**CRITICAL:** This protocol is optimized for an automated liquid handler. All dispense steps should be programmed accordingly, ensuring correct tip types, head configuration (e.g., 96-well or 384-well mode), and dispense positions are used for each step.\n\n### Day 1: Plate Preparation and Sample Lysis\n*Estimated timing: 2-3 hours*\n\n1.  Collect your samples (e.g., single cells, tissue biopsies) using a laser micro dissector into the wells of a 384-well PCR plate.\n2.  Seal the plate with an adhesive foil and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min to pellet the samples.\n3.  Carefully remove the seal.\n4.  **Plate Rinsing:** Using the automated liquid handler, perform four rinse cycles by dispensing 7 µL of 100% ACN into each well.\n5.  Seal the plate with a new adhesive foil and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min.\n6.  Carefully remove the seal. Dry the plate completely in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator at 45°C for approximately 30 min.\n7.  **Cell Lysis:** Using the automated liquid handler, add 7 µL of Lysis Buffer to each sample well.\n8.  Seal the plate securely with two layers of adhesive foil to prevent evaporation. Place two metal plates on top of the plate if necessary, fitting them between the plate and the PCR cycler.\n9.  Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 2 min to collect the liquid at the bottom of the wells.\n10. Place the plate in a PCR thermocycler and incubate with a heated lid using the appropriate program:\n    *   **For cells:** 95°C for 30 min.\n    *   **For tissues:** 95°C for 60 min.\n11. Allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n12. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min. Carefully remove the foil seals.\n13. Add 1 µL of 100% ACN to each well.\n14. Reseal the plate with two new adhesive foils and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min.\n15. Place the plate back into the thermocycler, ensuring the two metal plates are placed on top if needed, and incubate with a heated lid:\n    *   **For cells:** 75°C for 30 min.\n    *   **For tissues:** 75°C for 60 min.\n16. Allow the plate to cool to room temperature.\n17. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 1 min before proceeding.\n\n### Day 1: Protein Digestion\n*Estimated timing: 30 minutes + overnight incubation*\n\n18. Carefully remove the foil seals.\n19. Using the automated liquid handler, add 2 µL of freshly prepared Digestion Buffer to each well. The total sample volume is now approximately 10 µL.\n20.
